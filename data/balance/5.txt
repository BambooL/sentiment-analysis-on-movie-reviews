 The scenes in this film can be very disquieting due to their graphic re-enactment of real events, but this story needs to be told. I will say the violence was injected into the movie with as much taste as manageable when dealing with rape scenes, etc. Inspired by true events, women are being murdered in Juarez after they leave the factory where they work. A fearful community is suddenly given some hope when one of the young victims not only lives, but experiences 'stigmata' after seeing the Virgin Mary.  I was shocked to learn that murders in Juarez are still happening and many are unsolved. I believe this director brought a very important story to the surface. Though it's never pleasant to think about young women being murdered, this movie depicts a harsh reality of the high cost of exploited-cheap labor.  Chrissy K. McVay - Author
 Over the past few years, public television has put on a series of vintage  Doo Wop   and Rock 'N' Roll concert reunions that have been absolutely flawless.  This latest dvd  Rock, Rhythm And  Doo Wop , is a total delight to ones ears.  Keep in mind all these vintage artists recorded in an era, when vocal talent was essential, to get a recording contract?  They did not have modern day computerized overdub technology, which enables many modern day artist's with limited ability to survive?  This dvd reads like a who's who of early rock.  The architect of rock, Little Richard starts off this concert with a stomping version of  Keep-A Rockin , and the line-up that follows, keeps this concert at a premium level of performances.  You get to see and hear Lou Christie, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Jerry Butler, Lloyd Price, Joey Dee and the Starliters, Frankie Valli, Fred Paris and the Satins and the Countours, just to name a few.  However, nothing prepared me for the performance of Jay Black and the Americans?  After singing  This Magic Moment , Jay gave a performance, that could make anybody from the babyboomer era feel young again.  As he prepared to sing  Cara Mia , he joked that he first recorded the song at age 25, and must now at age 62, hit those same notes?  Hit those notes he did!  Using that opera trained voice, he delivered a powerful performance that had the entire audience on it's feet, showering him with a well deserved standing ovation.  If you are a fan of the old-time vocal and rock sound of the 50's and 60's, this is an absolute must have dvd.  I highly recommend this to everyone, who enjoys those golden oldies.
 I recvd this video (DVD version) as a Christmas gift.  I put it on about 11 pm just to see what it was like, and finally got dragged to bed about 4
 Wow! When I saw this show on PBS--that was it, I had to have this!  What great tunes!  And seeing these groups--terrific! I couldn't find a list of songs, so here's some of them
 Having worked in television for 34 years I can tell you that this is one of the finest doo-wop DVD's you will ever see. It is done with class and a great respect for the talent. Congratulations to T.J. Lubinsky the producer. Having been brought up in the Bronx and lived through the era of street corner singing I advise you to pick this up today. the performance by Little Anthony and the Imperials on  Two Kinds of People In The World  is worth the price alone. I have played this piece over and over. All the performances are great - buy it - you will be a fan of TJ Lubinsky and his special admiration for what I was lucky and privileged enough to live through.
 The people who have reviewed this DVD before me have said it all! It is just great! Came across the concert on PBS one night and decided to buy it then and there. After viewing it once I also bought DOO WOP 50 and DOO WOP 51. What a wonderful nostalgic trip to the past! You will never regret buying this DVD.
 I have all of the doo wop DVD's and this one is as good or better than the 1st ones. Remember once these performers are gone, we'll never get to see them again. Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you'll LOVE this DVD !!
 Get it, also get Dop Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51. Each performances is like the original 45's, except with modern, nice ,crisp sound like today's cds.
 Excellent, excellent performers.  Excellent video and audio quality.  Buy this DVD and go back in time.  Well worth the time waiting for almost a year to get hold of the DVD.
 This video is awesome and of particular interest to anyone who grew up with the great music of the 50's and 60's.  The Duprees were wonderful!  Also, Jay Black's Cara Mia gave me goose bumps.  It doesn't matter how old these guys are, they can still belt out quite a song.  Little Anthony and the Imperials were also very, very good!  They have recaputured the sounds of the music they way we remembered it!  The backup musicians deserve an huge amount of praise. This is one you do not want to miss!  I recommend it HIGHLY!
 As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I thought Little Richard's appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford's Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of "Two Kinds of People in the World", and Jay Black and the Americans' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn't get a performance of their own, because they are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD library.  Some notes here
 I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this program, and I second everything the other reviewer wrote.  I used most of these songs in my after school music class with 5th and 6th graders and they love it.  We first sang the songs off lyric sheets and from CD's and then watched the DVD.  They enjoyed it so much I ordered a DVD copy for each of my students as a present for joining the class.  I would suggest ordering the DVD version since it has about eight interviews with artists from the program in addition to six extra songs that aren't available on the VHS version.  The DVD version is now available only from PBS.  The singers may be older than when they first made these songs hits, but they can still sing them as well as ever.  My only complaint with it is it has five songs by Little Anthony and the Imperials.  Two would have been enough with maybe a second song from some of the other singers in their place.  Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with either the VHS or DVD version.  I prefer the DVD since it includes extra songs and interviews that the VHS version doesn't have.
 well,this just goes to show why you don't blindly accept a critics review. I own a yellow lab(2) and I can tell you this is a pretty realistic. Yes I guess the critics would like to see a gloom and doom ending but I dont think they heard of the true story of when one of these trmendously faithful conpanions carried his master half a mile back to his home after he suffered a near fatal heart attack(would have been fatal if not for yellows actions). It is a very heartwarming  story without being predictable and just fantastic views. The heck with critics. Buy this because it makes you feel good and that there wasnt a need for explosions or car chases or guns to provide for interesting viewing.
 The cover of our DVD of "Far From Home says in large letters
 I would beg to differ with the above description of the film. This is not the typical  A-boy-and-his-pet  film. The story is more realistic than the typical film of its genre such as  Flipper  or   Lassie  and lacks the obvious manipulations of an  Air  Bud.  The characters look like real people. (Watch how Angus' little  brother dresses himself. Anyone who has been around a six-year old can see  their child dressing like this). Angus's and Yellow's fight through the  wilderness is not glossed over or  Disneyfied.  The  cinematography is beautiful. This film is wonderful for the whole family,  not just for the six-year old.
 As owners of a Yellow Lab, we just might be a bit biased, but we were mesmerized by this movie.  The adventures of a lost boy and dog.  Of course the ending is predictable.  We knew that.  But the story line, the fabulous scenery, the cinematography, the acting, the sub-plots and the adventure make this a must-see movie for the whole family - Preview it before showing it to the very young; they might be traumatized by the scary parts.  Buy "Far From Home...  a guaranteed winner.  You'll be watching it over and over again.
 You don't have to own a Yellow Lab to absolutley love this movie, but true dog lovers will find it irrestible. A young boy takes in a lost Yellow lab, and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog. The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.   After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships.
 You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film.  This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy.  It has something for everyone.  Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama.  A few scary moments for the young ones, but nothing they can't handle.  A few sprinkles of romance.  Lots of dog-boy bonding.  The ending is predictable for all but the very young, but delightful nonetheless.  Best of all, it's just a delightful movie free of violence, car chases, shoot-outs and antagonists!  This movie was engaging from start to finish.  On par with <a href="http
 This is by far one of the best American Movies, that I have seen in a very long time. It was indeed a true American reality show.
 I have no words, really my wife would not stop mourn the end of the movie.intense, surprising, sad, happy, sentimental, inspiring, emotional,
 A refreshing, family movie!  A dog finds a boy, boy keeps dog only if he takes complete care of him.  Dog, he names Yellow, becomes boys best friend.  A functional family teaching their son responsibility.  The scenery in this movie is beautiful. You will laugh, smile, and have tears....ending with joy.  Years ago we purchased this movie for ourselves after seeing it on HBO.  We have since purchased it for adults and for children.
 The first time I viewed this film I was a young teen. Now as a 29 year old guy I find this film just as entertaining as I did all those years ago. In a nutshell this is a film about a boy and the dog who found him,changed him,and saved his life when they were both shipwrecked. This film will appeal to anyone from 5 to 95 who enjoy clean adventurous family films.
 My sister and her husband requested this movie...thanx for delivering it in a timely manner...
 This is my grandson's favorite movie, and he watches it over and over again.  A boy lost in the NW rainforest with his dog, who saves his life.  Great stuff.  A real tear-jerker, too.
 This is a fantastic movie for the whole family. The scenery was incredible in the movie.
 They just dont make movies like this any more. A great movie for any movie library a must have. One you will bring out to watch for years to come!
 My family loved this adventure, especially my boys, 7 & 8.  We laughed, we cried, it became a part of us.... ;)
 The movie still amazes and touches me even seeing it for the 3rd time. I want to see this movie everytime i remember my dog, Huck Finn - i can say he is also a yellow dog.  The actors are great. The pictures are all natural.
 Just like the title says, Good Family Video. This movie+ your family + popcorn = Great family night with the kids.
 I disagree with the reviewers who said the movie was predictable and drawn out.  It was a movie with heart and you could feel the main characters plight when he lost his companion.  Being an animal lover I was pulling for the happy ending (of Course).  I am Disney's biggest fan and I love this movie right along with the others. (P.S.  I am a Grandmother to eleven.)  Thank heavens for Disney Movies.
 It is a funny movie, but I think there is way too much cursing, it takes away from the movie....
 This is a great movie especially if you were a young adult during the early 90's.  Dr. Dre and Ed Lover are a great pair, very funny.  Dennis Leary is hysterical.  So many quotable quotes!  The parade of rap stars actually enhances the movie. It's not a serious movie, more like really long funny skit.
 This video covers phonics to a deep extent, and may be a little too much for beginners. Mouth movement is included, and is an extremely useful learning tool. Occasionally, however, they just show the lip movement without showing pictures of the object corresponding to the word. Nevertheless, my son is a fast learner so it worked out perfectly for us. A hidden gem.
 The Reaper is a fantastic show filled with wild scenarios on how Sam and friends have to catch the different souls that escaped from Hell.  The only downside of the show was it only lasted two seasons.  I already bought the show in HD via Xbox Live.  Glad to see it on Amazon.com VOD.  I would have bought from here first if it was available at the time.  Wish show would come out on Blu-ray.  Season 2 even got better when the guys move out and get their own apartment.  Kevin Smith directed the pilot episode. Enjoy.
 Recording with an audience of less than 1,000, this DVD feels like a club recording with it's Dolby Ditigal and DTS audio sound.  Host Mark McEwen gushes a tad much and the 'Live by Request' gimmick is not original.  Still, it manages to captivate.  Fifteen songs (one a medley of eight), five being from the last album, it's a collection that defies the ear with the groups tight instrumentals and harmonies.   She Keep On Coming  and  You Should Be Dancing  rock the house, while  Sacred Trust  and  How Can You Mend A Broken Heart  lull the audience into a trance.  This recording is unique in that there are plenty of star 'call-ins' and lots of joking around.  Its surprising to hear Barry sing,  Woman In Love , but  Nights On Broadway  is, once again, cut far too short for a song that contains some of their best work. This is as close as a great live recording gets and a DVD well worth owning.   One Night Only  is a great live recording as well, but nothing matches the intimacy of this presentation.
 This is an awesome concert because the Bee Gees are so relaxed and spontaneous!  It was even fun listening to the request call-ins.  Some of the women said the same things I would have said if I had been able to view it live.  Love those guys!! Also, they performed songs that are not in some of their other recorded concerts.  I highly recommend this DVD!
 I own this DVD, along with their "One Night Only DVD, & I have to tell you--I love 'em both!! They sound just as good (or better) as when they were younger--I play one after the other at times (there are a few new songs on "This Is Where I Came In") on my stereo, set for DTS--ohhhh the sound is INCREDIBLE!!  I catch myself "boogie-ing"(not sure how to spell that--sorry) constantly...I'm 31 years old & LOVE the Bee Gees!!  What more can I say? 
 I purchased two DVDs, one for my parents who are huge Bee Gee fans (they're in their late 60s) and one for myself.  As African Americans our (my family) taste in music is culturally diverse and the Bee Gees are on the top of our lists.  This concert is a definite must see ranking right up there with their "One Night Only concert.  Several songs on this DVD I've never heard before but they have become my favorites. The Bee Gees were very playful/silly/funny in this concert which was a treat to see that different aspect of the group.
 I have been a Bee Gees fan for years.  It is really wonderful to see them again.  I love the songs from the new album  This is Where I In .  It is really great to hear Maurice take the lead in two of the songs,  Man in the Middle  and  Walking on Air .  While Barry and Robin have beautiful voices, I really enjoy listening to Maurice sing. After all these years, it is really great to see and hear the joy they still get from their music and from preforming together. While precious minutes of the show were taken up with requests, it was still nice to see their interaction with the fans.  I think anyone who is a fan of Barry, Robin and Maurice will enjoy this video.  I have watched it over and over.  It is really sad that we won't have the chance to see the three of them together like this again.
 Although this movie is broke up into two different parts, it was very good.  Since the movie was done in two parts, the second one repeats a lot as if one was not there to view the first part.  I did not like that at all.  The point to this movie is really good.  I'm actually going to send it to someone that has held "life against God.  This is an excellent ministering tool!!
 This DVD was very helpful for those who had lost a loved one in our family of faith. It was able to show that we are not alone in our loss or pain and that while our loved ones are gone from here --- they are still with us in spirit. It made our faith stronger and brought our family closer together in God's love. Louie Giglio is a Christian who's spirit sends a loving message from his heart.
 The whole Passion Series is life changing, a must have for any Christian household that has teenagers and young adults.  Louie has wonderful approach to teaching about the magnificence of God, the Creater of Heaven and Earth!  My  16 year old niece was so impressed and awe-struck after viewing "How Great is Our God and "Indescribable that she ended up taking the whole series home with her to share with all her friends.  Needless to say, I let her keep them and purchased a new series for myself. I am going to be showing my Bible study group "How Great is Our God tonight as we have a skeptic in our group.  I know this video will dispel any doubts she may have about God!  The "Hope video is equally inspiring in a different way, more focused on real life rather than creation.  It is a compliment to the "Fruitcake and Ice Cream video which deals with a real life story of a young college student who comes to know Christ.
 This is an amazing video for those who are suffering. When life hurts most, when the bottom falls out, when tragedy strikes I need to know, "Is there still hope for me? Louie answers a resounding YES. He explores the topic of suffering better than anyone I've heard. I was deeply inspired by this two-part video series. I recommend you buy it if you're hurting.
 This DVD is the third in the Passion 2006 series done by Louie Giglio.  The four videos go in order, so it is helpful to see them in order to follow the story throughout all of them.  However, having said that, this is still a very moving presentation about pain, suffering, and hope.  I would recommend this for high school and older, for Christians and non-Christians.  You can watch this with someone who is suffering, and no one has to say a word at the end.  It is not intrusive or offensive, but is comforting because it is about the God who is truly big enough to comfort anyone in the worst circumstances in life.  And everyone experiences them at some point.  With this Hope presentation, and with all of them in the series, you definitely will sense that God does the supernatural "heavy lifting that no human possibly can.  Excellent for mentoring teens and older.  The audience in the video is largely college age.  Highly recommended!
 This is an awesome addition to your movie collection!... A great tool to use to witness to others. All four are great and I think that you need all four. We own all four and even our children are interested in the series. They even repeat things that are stated in the serious. We are all amazed at the topics and images. You will have to see this for yourself. If you have viewed any of the others, Hope is a must view as well. There really are not any words to describe the experience of viewing Hope. Also there is no statement that can tell you the experience of owning all four to share with others. You never know when you may encounter someone who may need what is in this series and you to can use this series to win souls, and bring someone out of the darkness and into the light.  Our souls have truly been blessed by this series... we plan to bless others when they visit us with this series. Go ahead and Bless yourself, family, and friends with this awesome series, make sure you get all four and view them all. We tried to view them in the order that they are listed inside of the dvd. I don't know if it matters, as it is just what we did. Now we are waiting on the Blind side to come out.. Enjoy! You won't be the same! A treat for the whole family, friends, church family, and the neighborhood! Don't forget the popcorn! We use the crazy popcorn popper it is awesome with movies or without!  This is one series that we are glad we did not pass by... all cultures will and should enjoy this!  Always watch what you do and say to others as you never know what they are going through, or the impact you will have on them, and you never know who you are entertaining.  Keep up the Good Work Louie Giglio!
 This two part video tells where our only Hope lies, in Jesus Christ.  Louis is a great communicator who uses stories about real people and the Word of God to point out our only hope when difficulties in life arise, and they will.  It is a great resource for encouragement when life's hurts hit.  I recommend it to anyone, believer in Christ or not.
 Louie has some of the most inspirational an thought provoking sermons I have ever heard. He is truly anointed!
 This is one of my all-time favorite movies for escaping from worldly work.  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce have great chemistry and the trials of Edmond Dantes are laid out (although too brief for me) in historically correct detail. Even though this movie loosely follows Dumas' book, the story has such a karmic ending that it always lifts my sprits.
 LOVE this movie - loved it when it first came out and still love it - awesome shots and wonderful story line....Jim C is an AMAZING actor!
 This movie has everything I like
 Great Blu-ray DVD for the price!  The graphic and sound quality is excellent.  The product was received less than 7 days and was well packaged.
 I love to read and am normally disappointed in the movies which are based on those books. This is the exception. Great, believable characters. Excellent character development. And some sword play and action to keep the men in your life interested.
 Start with great material like the classic book this film is based on, use a great director, pick great locations, assemble an incredible cast mixing well known with newer actors, and then adapt the book in a brilliant screenplay, and you end up with a movie like this that is everything a movie should be.  Adventure, mystery, romance, action sequences, character and plot development, and humor are all combined into a masterpiece.  The 1,000 page book by Dumas is, of course, a beloved classic with the theme of what would perfect revenge be like.  The book has complicated twists and a darker tone with an ending that feels like a let down in many ways.  Incredibly, the screenplay manages to summarize the book and include enough adaptations and a much more positive ending.  I can't say enough good about this screenplay and how well this movie adapts an intricate novel that would be impossible to film if you kept strictly to the plot of the novel.  The screenplay is perfectly balanced.  If you have watched several current adventure movies where the lighting is so dark, the action so blurred, the characters so poorly developed, and the plot so weak that you aren't even sure who you are watching and why they are doing whatever it is they are doing on the screen, you will appreciate the pacing of this film with clear lighting and a sound track that even grandfather can understand.  The acting is perfect with no grandiloquent flourishes but enough idiosyncracy that each character seems perfectly drawn.  Caviezel just couldn't be better as the lead character Dantes who is betrayed by his best friend who marries his girlfriend and sends him to prison for life.  Dantes meets a wise prisoner with knowledge of a hidden fortune, played by the late Richard Harris, and eventually escapes and wreaks a carefully plotted revenge on each and every enemy who had wronged him.  Without giving any more of the plot away, let me just say that this is the way movies should be and that the whole family will love this movie and watch it again and again as mine has.  Available in several formats, and for a great price since this movie has been out for nearly 10 years, I definitely recommend this movie highly.  Five stars.
 I have to say I was so impressed with this movie.  It is a great movie, and though not a Christian movie, it has a lot of God themes mingled in between.  I highly recommend this movie.  I am buying 2 other to give away.  SEE it, you will not be disappointed.
 The movie was great I like it I actually ordered as a gift I already own it.  The price was good and so was the delivery.  Happy with the order.
 The Count Of Monte Cristo is an all around great movie. You have an excellent story line and plot. You get action, suspense, romance and even a couple of laughs. All this in a movie without nudity, sex or bad language. There is violence, but not in the excessive, graphic way we have come to expect from Hollywood. This movie is proof positive that you don't have to have explicit sex, language or blood and guts to have a great movie! I highly recommend it.
 Richard Harris and Guy  Pearce made this movie great. All of the actors were superb and I think that the actual Chateau D'If was used. Superb in every way except not long enough.
 I didn't know what to expect when I first saw this movie in theaters, but I loved the whole movie.  The action, plot, suspense...wonderfully wrapped into this movie.  I enjoyed the movie so much that I have started to read the book.  A classic book and great movie. Revenge is so well portrayed in this movie.  Vengence, honor, love, justice.  So good!  This is my favorite movie to date!
 I am not a movie fan.  I find it difficult to sit and watch a story for 2 hours (and nearly impossible to 'suspend disbelief').  I will not pretend to write a clinical analysis of movie-making.  I will simply say I have seen this movie twice (and plan to see it again, nearly unheard of in my case) and both times was fully enveloped in this fascinating, beautifully told story.  That editing and departure from the novel occurred in some points is no surprise (just 2 hours), but the essence of the story remains, the victory of good over evil.  Tremendous movie.
 So much better than any movie I have seen lately.  I had never read the book or seen the movie and I just loved it.  It captured my imagination and the acting was so believable.  Jim C. was the Count.  I want to see it again and again.
 This is a wonderful movie. I bought this for my Mom she just loves it! The process was extreamly fast and hastle free at Amazon.
 This is a well done movie of my favourite story to date.  There's some time spent in France and then it's around the world in a tale that makes me shiver even now.  Although the book of the same title by Alexander Dumus was where they got the name and stuff the story does come out a little better than the book in more ways than one.  This is not an easy story to put on the silver screen and I think personally this version is the first one you should see.  Boy has girl, boy has a friend, boy has his dreams come true... boy doing there... who me Tarzan?  While this movie adeptly manages to come off new and exiting in it's production it still manages to fit in to the scheme of things from Hollywood and even to this day.  Splendid acting by the cast and each stands out as if personally involved in the whole idea of the thing. The sets are over the top.  There are some mansions and country-estates that make my mouth water even if because of the scene requiring dimly lit rooms.
 ACTION,ADVENTURE, INTRIGE, ROMANCE this movie has it all.This is Jim's finest film...he was better in this than the PASSION OF THE CHRIST. I have never read the book, but, I probably will now.  There is no relaxing in this movie has it has a lot of twists. I am amazed that the casting Director could take 3 unknowns and cast them perfectly.  In addition, the young man that played Jim's son must be his brother, cousin,etc in real life because he looks just like him. The end is a little predicatable but very satisfying.
 A very well-done film and an excellent cast.  I'd put it right up with the Three and Four Musketeers movies (York, Reed, Chamberlain, Heston, etc).
 It is one of the best films I have seen and seen and seen. I can't tell you how many times I have watched this movie and still enjoy watching it again. The acting is surperb and the quality of the story is deep, entertaining, and thought provoking. An awesome buy and the purpose of owning is to watch it and watch it again and again if not why not just rent.
 this movie is incredible. very captivating from beginning to end. sensational movie, very well done, and played out. truly stands up to the book, which was beautifully written. a bit of difference, but came out well enough to be a success. the count of monte cristo has so much in it. a young man, innocent, trusting, and in love losses it all in a second because of his suppose friends jelousy. all is taken and all hope seems lost, until he meets a friend, meanwhile his anger and vengance grow. he returns to a whole different world. his only thought is revenge, but so many twists and turns he doesn't even expect what happens to happen. this has innocence, betrayel, cruelty, hardship, vengance, love, and friendship all in one. beautiful story, a hard era, and excellent film. the actors were superb. jim caviezel, a wonderful actor. there's just something about him that makes him very interesting to watch. those eyes just draw you in and his talent, makes him great. he was spectacular in this film. guy pearce, shined his on his own behalf. did it so well that you actually hated him in this movie. all of the actors were great, made it so dramatic, it was believable. nicely done.
 There is nothing bad to say about this movie.  The story, the acting, everything is well done.  I bought it to watch over and over.
 This is a movie that should be included in everyones cinema collection!  The scenes and fantastic cast taps into every emotion.  I was at the edge of my seat for more than one scene!  I will enjoy watching this movie for years to come.
 This is one of the best films I have seen. It's in great shape, I don't remember, but it may have been new. It works perfectly, and I am so lucky to own it.
 The Count of Monte Cristo was one of my most favorite novels during my teenage years. I was skeptical of its yet another remake but decided to give it a try. However, both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised to find a well-directed movie with superior acting by James Caviezel. He's done a splendid job by portraying first the innocence of happy youth and then becoming the embodiment of righteous, yet calculated revenge. I also really enjoyed the fact that the leading characters were not cast by the "bigger names. Save your time and money -skip Moulin Rouge and see this great movie! In my opinion, it deserves more attention and praise from critics and the media than it has gotten so far.
 The first time I watched this movie, my cousin brought it over to my house on a movie night.  when she said what she was bringing to watch, i said "what? the count of who?  never heard of it and immediately assumed that it would be not worth my time.  I was mistaken.  I could not take my eyes off of the movie and spent the next 2 hours enthralled.  if you are wondering whether this is worth the money.....spend it, you'll definately be happy you did.
 Based on the Dumas story, this fabulous adventure about a naive, illiterate young man in 19th century France whose fate embroils him in treachery and vengeance, is well written with wit and intelligence, and abridges a complex plot into a cohesive 131 minute film. The location cinematography in Malta and Ireland is spectacular, though my one and only complaint about this film is that occasionally some of the indoor sequences tend to be a little murky. The soundtrack by Edward Shearmur is also top-notch, and adds a lot to the film. The cast
 This is, by far, the best rendition for the big screen of the novel by Dumas (although it's not 100% close to the book) and, by far, one of the best movies in recent years. What other movie do you remember going to, where, at the end, while the titles scroll, a roar of applause comes from the audience? I've lended my DVD to a few skeptic friends and all not only liked the movie, they LOVED IT! Wonderfully acted, with wonderful scenery, this movie truly deserves more credit that it has gotten. STARS hands down!
 the perfect movie great plot exceptional ending must see movie
 Do you remember having to read this story in high school literature? I enjoyed it then and I love it even more now.  The movie graphics are so much better than my imagination.  It has all of the essentials to satisfy both mine and my husbands movie expectations - romance, intrigue, sword fights, action. Definitely a movie to add to your collection.
 This is one of our favorite movies.  We seldom like to see a movie more than twice.  However, this movie was so entertaining (as well as it contained excellent drama, acting, and a well developed plot), that we have viewed it numerous times.  My Teenage kids as well as my younger boys enjoyed the movie.  I did have to re-explain some moral issues & contradictions concerning the implied premarital sex and adultery.  We used the theme of revenge vs forgiveness as a discussion tool. It was also refreshing to see a movie with positive references to God and still be exciting.  We are going to read the book this summer, and We don't expect the book and the movie to be exactly the same.  They are two different expressions.
 I'll admit, I've not read the original source novel on which this is based (the only thing by Dumas I have read, is the classic 'Musketeers'); life is too short to read every great novel, try as one might - but having seen this film, I am determined to seek out the text.   Judging the film on its own terms, I found this immensely satisfying, and though quite long (131 min), it does not drag for a second. The story itself is really quite something, and no matter how many films you have seen, or books you have read, you will be absolutely bowled over (as George Bernard Shaw was) by the breadth, depth, simplicity and universality of it.   There are some minor faults with the film; sometimes the dialogue seems a little stilted (eg. Guy Pearce, an Australian who has mastered a range of accents, seems a little too much of a cookie-cutter villain
 Most of the older style movies really turn me off, but not this one. I really enjoyed it. Too many of the  old  ones try too hard to be dramatic -- kinda like high school actors who have to talk too loud and be too flamboyant. This movie was a pleasant surprise. The actors are really good. The plot is good and keeps you in your seat. Some of the things are a little predictable, but it is hard not to want to make sure that your hopes come true. You can feel yourself cringe and want to shout  don't do this  or  don't do that  or  get'em . The cinematography is very good and appropriate. There are not some of the anachronisms of many other film interpretations. If you watch one  old style  movie per year, this one should be the one you watch this year.
 This movie was truly amazing! Jim Caviezel was excellent as the count, and you loved to hate Guy Pearce as his friend-gone-enemy. The cenimatography was beautiful, and while it was long, you love every minute of it. There are some well done action sequences (with quickened framework that adds to the tension) and the adaptation from the novel (while forced to leave a lot out, obviously...the book is insanely long!)is far better than most works of this sort. It maintains a more comic-book approach to violence and gore (the same as Mask Of Zorro, in that they leave a lot of blood and guts out, so if you're looking for shredded bodies go elsewhere) and it's well worth your while!
 I love, LOVE this movie. I could watch it over and over and over again... I'm so glad I could find it online. Jim plays his role well.
 Like many of us, I slogged through the book during my highschool years. I read the "cheater comic. This picture, although a little off the original storyline is one of the best remakes I have seen. The cast is marvelous and the twists and turns are presented well. The picture falters slightly toward the end but it is a minimal fault. Overall, the DVD is eminently watchable and good fun. The quality is excellent. Amazon seems to consistently present good, quality DVD's at good quality prices. The disc came on time and I was happy to add it to my library.
 Amazing movie. I saw it in a huge tv screen after hooking up my computer in my tv. The quality was amazing and the speed just perfect like a DVD.
 BEST MOVIE EVER. Love the book, love the movie. You can't go wrong with this classic, so I would definitely recommend it!
 I have always loved this movie and now I can see it on the go! The picture quality is awesome! U won't regret gettin this movie
 This is my Gransons Favorite movie and we needed an extra copy cuz our old one was WEARING OUT! Thanks for speedy service too!
 I rented this movie to have a small idea of what it was about because I was monitoring the homework of a 9th. grader tasked with reading the book and answering questions.  It seems to have followed the book fairly closely.  At least I could ask relative questions.  It was well worth the rental fee.
 We were highly entertained. It is a very well made movie with good acting for the most part. Can't go wrong with it.
 I have watched this movie numerous times. I have always enjoyed the overall theme of this movie. I will probably watch it again.
 After attending the release of "The Count of Monte Cristo, a friend made the remark that he believed the movie could benefit from additional fight sequences. Immediately my mind shot back to last year's "The Musketeer, also based (rather loosely, I might add) on another of Alexandre Dumas' famous classics. In that film, character development, story, and tone were sacrificed for the sake of creating yet another movie in which a choreographer of Chinese descent was allowed to make an impression on action aficionados by dazzling them with techniques reminiscent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  What a relief that this latest adaptation of a Dumas novel strays from the usual clich&eacute;s and redundancy of bringing a classic work of literature to the screen, coming out as a sturdy, well-guided costume drama that combines action, intensity, passion, and most importantly, revenge. With a script that keeps much of the novel's intricacies intact, a cast befitting of their roles, and a director who keeps things interesting at all times, this is one swashbuckling adventure that pleases in all fields.  The story centers around Edmund Dantes (Jim Caviezel), a sailor from a middle class upbringing in the town of Marseilles. He has a friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce), whose father is a wealthy aristocrat; despite his rich lifestyle, Mondego still harbors a slight jealousy for Dantes, who has just been promoted to captain of his vessel, allowing him the opportunity to marry his longtime love, Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). Overcome by envy, Mondego concocts a vicious plan with the equally jealous first mate of Dantes' boat that lands a wrongfully accused Dantes in the Chateau d'If for more than a decade. During his years of imprisonment, Dantes' resolve is strengthened by brutal beatings, and by his friendship with fellow prisoner Faria (Richard Harris), who teaches Dantes to read and write, the articulate moves of swordplay, and offers him the location of a long-lost treasure that would give him the means to exact his revenge on those who have wronged him. Faria's death provides Dantes the method of escape he needs, and once out, he begins his quest.  The second half of the movie takes the movie to new heights of interest, as Dantes makes his big entrance in Paris as the Count of Monte Cristo, bent on exacting his revenge on Mondego, now married to a repressed, sullen Mercedes, and on Villefort, the police chief who played a role in his wrongful incarceration. Anyone familiar with revenge plots is well aware that this is a dish best served cold, and many will delight in the cooly calculated revelations and confrontations that arise as Dantes's master plan begins to unfold.  Accompanying this feeling of satisfaction is the movie's wondrous appearance and execution. The look and feel of the film drips with the quality of the swashbuckling adventures of yesteryear, with its themes of vengeance and nobility, it's glorious costumes and set design, and a final showdown that provides a slam-bang finish complete with suspense and fist-clenching thrills. Reynolds, and screenwriter Jay Wolpert, have realized the novel for the screen in a manner that is pleasing to the eye and the mind, keeping in touch with everything that has immortalized Dumas' work without reworking key moments to make room for modern artistic influences. If this weren't enough to please popcorn audiences and literary buffs, the cast is completely remarkable. Jim Caviezel plays Dantes with the conviction of a man wrongfully accused; by the time he escapes prison, we are all for him and his brilliantly conceived plan. His chemistry with leading lady Dagmara Dominczyk is a welcome slice of old-fashioned romance, while his scenes with Guy Pearce provide a nice contrast of nobility and jealousy, which Pearce perfects in his performance as Mondego. Also worthy of noting are the appearances of Richard Harris and Lius Guzman, who provide humorous touches throughout.  More than anything else, this latest big-screen version of "The Count of Monte Cristo is a wonderful popcorn adventure replete with everything you could possibly ask for in a film of this sort. Overall, it remains faithful enough to its source, and keeps us enlightened and entertained throughout its well-acted, well-directed, well-executed duration. Count on revenge, and then some.
 In this time of fire and explosion oriented blockbuster movies it is indeed refreshing to find a remake of a classic novel of the quality of The Count of Monte Cristo currently available.  I happened to nonchalantly choose this film at the DVD outlet as a source of viewing background for an evening of desk work.  WRONG!  This superbly made film of the Dumas' novel is excellent and gripping on every level.  The quality of the film, shot in Ireland and Malta, is visually stunning, the story remains true to the original, and the cast is outstanding.  James Caviezel makes a star turn in the title role, aided by the always excellent Guy Pearce, the veteran Richard Harris, the here venomous James Frain, a fine and very different role for Luis Guzman, and the elegantly beautiful Dagmara Domincyzk.  The movie is beautifully paced, the long prison scenes allow Caviezel and Harris to create tremendous rapport, and the age old theme of REVENGE has rarely been played out so well.  This is a beautiful period piece, finely photographed and scored and edited and directed.  For a taste of just how exciting the old tales can be visually, treat yourself to an evening with The Count!
 Like the previous reviewer, I too was fortunate enough to catch this last Tuesday at a sneak preview in NY.  This was simply magnificent in every possible way. The acting, script, cinematography were stunning.  I just want to say something
 I have read the (unabridged) Count of Monte Christo book at least 4 times and can quote many of the scenes and dialogue. However I am not a literalist when it comes to Hollywood, because movies are not a literary medium. The best we can hope is that Hollywood captures the essence of the book, which I believe the makers of the Count of Monte Christo have done - and done very well.  While I agree that it is not a faithful retelling of Dumas' original, it is a fine film that captures the heart of Dumas' message
 This is definetly not Dumas Count of Monte Cristo. It doesn't follow the book close at times and is far fetched from it at others. It is however a great movie and a great way to introduce this young generation to Dumas. The Count of Monte Cristo tells the tale of Edmund Dantes. A man that is imprisoned for a crime by his best friend Fernand Mondego that he did not commit. He spends 13 years in jail at the Chateau'If.(thats not how you spell it but it's close enough for me) It's there that Edmund meets a fellow prisonman that trains him in literature, economics, and swordplay. Dantes gets out of jail then goes a spree for revenge to get the men who put him jail. This is a great story of revenge. Jim Cavaziel is perfects as Dantes. He does a great job. He has a swagger and plays Edmund great when he poor and when he's rich. He shows his abilities as a good actor because of the different levels to the character. I'm really impressed with him and hope to see him more in the future. Guy Pearce is good as Fernadn Mondego. I was first impressed with Pearce in L.A. Confidential. It's good to see him finally showing his acting abilities again. He plays a great bad guy. You can't stand his character and that's because Pearce plays him so good. This is an awesome tail of revenge. If your a diehard Dumas fan you won't like this. I'd reccommend the Richard Chamberlin version for you. However if you like a fast paced tail of revenge full of swashbuckling this is the film for you. It's a great action film that reminds us why we go to the movies
 Jim Caviezel was great in this movie. Guy Pearce also played a great role. The new Superman Henry Cavill plays Albert Mondego the son of of The Count.
 I purchased this dvd for two reasons.  One , I've read the book many times, and it is a classic. I have seen many of the other productions, and I wanted too see how this one compared.  Two, I am a BIG fan of Jim Caviezel, and wanted to see his portrayal of the Count.  I was not disappointed on either count! It was timely and acting very well done.  I had seen this when it first came out, but seeing Person of Interest every week, I decided to buy the Count.  Great dvd for a fan!
 Amazing movie about love & deception. If you are in to suspense movies, definitely check this one out. Really great film.
 great movie and purchasing it was so easy. I received my order in just a couple of days.  Highly satisfied.
 I really recommend this movie, I think is one of the best movies ever, I can't get tired of watched. I just love it!!!!
 Wow! LOVED THIS MOVIE!! Only have this version with James Caviezel.  The acting that James had to partake, one day being Edmond Dantes, the next being ED in Chateau d'If then, then Counte Monte Cristo then again to ED in the prison...amazing how he kept his composure back and forth during the shoot.  Will watch only knows how many times. The book maybe better but that goes into great detail where as a movie can only be so long. Oh well, I will be happy with this DVD.  Too bad DVD's dont always want to add the bleeps and blunders.  Get to seee the seriousness or goofball side of an actor.
 I received a copy of this for my birthday, and I love it. This copy is great. The colors seem much more vivid and the sound much better. I think I could watch this over and over but never grow tired of it.  Some people have complained about the movie because it doesn't follow the book close enough. I agree that it doesn't follow the book closely, but that shouldn't detract from one's love for the movie. The full book is 1100 pages. It would be impossible to put that into a single movie. They would have to make it 3 separate films like Atlas Shrugged is being done.  This one is totally worth it.
 This must be the greatest revenge movie ever; despite the somewhat goofy cast and seeing it countless times never fails to bring on the tears. This is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time. I am forever a fan of Alexandre Dumas's most infamous work.
 This is a very good DVD, romantic and somewhat historical. It takes place around the time of Napolean's exile. I have watched this many times and have shared it with teenagers, who also love it.
 I love this movie! When I couldn't find it in my local stores and needed it right now I was able to get it for a reasonable price(was a birthday present to myself). I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a solid, action-packed experience!
 What is so wrong with making a movie and changing the story or plot a little.  As if Dumas' books are sacred writ...so many struggle to find any value in an adaptation.  If you ask me this movie was far more entertaining than either the book or any of the earlier films of the same title.  I enjoy a great rewrite.
 The service was fast and the dvd is new as I ordered it. So I am a very satisfied customer. I ordered the count of monte christ dvd.
 Great movie!  Enjoyable to watch and see how cleverly the hero exacts his revenge.  Not as good as the book but similar.  Well made, great acting, one you can watch again and again!
 I really enjoyed this movie. Does not follow the book really, but thats ok because I felt the movie was better. Overall, very enjoyable.
 While this movie defers from the book it is an amazing modern rendition of a classic novel. Good actors, costumes, and a good director bring this movie together into what I believe is one of the best versions of "The Count of Monte Cristo to date.
 This is a great movie with a little of everything. When one friend betrays another, it sends the main character life in a downward spiral. It is only at his lowest that someone comes and gives him the strength and intelligence that he so needs to plot his revenge on his betraying friend, whom he finds out married his to-be wife. If you are looking for a great movie to watch this would be it. 10 out of 10.
 DVD was delivered very fast, and was in perfect condition. Thank you for a great transaction. Would highly reccomend to everyone.
 The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the my favorite books. This movie is now one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to everyone!
 This was the first movie I viewed with Jim Caveizel acting. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, writing, and acting. It is an excellent story of redemption and justice. It has long been a favorite with our Family!
 Such a good story, I bought the book and dvd for my husband for christmas and he is really enjoying both!
 This is a great movie if you are looking for action and adventure. Has great actors and a great storyline.
 This is a great movie. My wife watches it over and over, about 7 times now.
 This is such a great re-make of the original that starred the late "Tony Curtis".  I love this movie.
 The movie is excellent in all respects; however, the company, MovieMars, is not.  First they sent an unusable CD due to it being the wrong Regional area.  Then when I sent it back, at the expense of $5.43 mailing fees, they refused to reimburse me for the postage.  They refunded the original fee for the CD, but not the postage for return fee.  They claimed I should have known what Region I am in and which CD would or would not work on my machine.  Well -- I have been renting, buying, and borrowing CDs for about 15 years and have never had this experience before.  I believe the CD they sent was meant for foreign markets and they should have known which one to send due to my return address.  Anyway -- they were nasty about it, and until I get the postage refunded to my Visa account, I will not be ordering from them, for sure, and probably not from Amazon.  After all, Amazon is the company that is truly in charge here.  Thank you.
 Good movie but ends differently from the book.  Had I not read the book, I would have enjoyed it more.  I bought the VHS used at a very good price.  I was very pleased.
 Action, Adventure & Love.  Great movie for teens and adults.  From rags to riches; good verses evil theme. Revenge is bad and doing what is right is the lesson.  Great acting and a great story!
 The director did a fine job in that he appealed to the 21st century audience.  The action involved and the forgiveness given to his love was not in the original book but I would not have enjoyed the movie unless he allowed for this change.  The original book was a bit morose.
 You can place this in that `far better than I remembered it being' category.  `The Count of Monte Cristo' is fun, exciting, intelligent and suspenseful, far more than I expected it to be and far better than I remembered it.  Having recently indulged in this forgotten gem once again, I'm finding myself kind of giddy.  This movie is fun.  If you are into the classic adventure films like `Swiss Family Robinson' and `Robinson Caruso', this film is right up there and certainly just as engaging.  You know, my initial dislike for this movie was probably plagued by a heavy dose of bias.  My parents lauded it, and so that is usually sparks an initial reaction of discomfort.  I mean, I pride myself on having better cinematic taste than they do, and so when they recommend something to me I'm usually hesitant.  Still, they saw the movie twice in the theater and encouraged me to accompany them on their THIRD trip to the movies.  I begrudgingly accepted the invitation.  Now, mind you, I don't think that Guy Pearce or Jim Caviezel are great actors.  Capable, yes, but no where near `great'.  I think that also clouded my appreciation for this film.  I was also merely sixteen when this film was released, so I kind of have an excuse for judging films with sharp bias.  Still, I did enjoy the film enough to buy it later on a whim and I've watched it several times since then.  Upon my most recent viewing I found the film elevating drastically for me.  The film tells the tale of Edmond Dantes, a middleclass sailor whose friend, the wealthy Fernand Mondego, is surprisingly jealous of Edmond's good fortune.  He has recently been promoted to captain of his vessel and has become engaged to his girlfriend, the ravishing Mercedes.  Spurned on by his jealousy, Fernand betrays his friend, concocting an elaborate and viscous scheme that lands Dantes imprisoned in the torturous Chateau d'If.  While in prison he bonds with a fellow prisoner who teaches him to fight, as well as articulating him, teaching him to read and write and converse as a gentleman.  Then he informs him of a hidden treasure and tells him the location.  Once Edmond finds a means of escape he uses his newfound knowledge to create a disguise, allowing him to exact revenge on the men responsible for his loss of thirteen years in prison.  With ravishing and passionate performances, stunning visual prowess and a sharply constructed script that breathes an air of believability in a premise that is undoubtedly far-fetched, `The Count of Monte Cristo' is nothing short of grade-A entertainment and serves as further proof that first impressions aren't always correct.
 Arrived quickly and excellently packaged. DVD in even better condition than description. Very happy.
 And even though the above quote is not taken from this movie, it did remind me a lot of it as I was watching this film. I could see this movie plenty of times and not get bored of it thanks to its clever script and wonderful acting by all personnel.  You probably know by now what `The Count of Monte Cristo' is all about so I will not bore you with the subject matter of the film. But what I will say is, if you enjoy seeing the enemy get no mercy -not necessarily getting killed- and thriving for vengeance at its best with witty `traps', then there is no exception for you to miss out on this movie.
 Great Movie I recommend to anyone to watch it....original movie, excellent condition..and on time shipping..
 This is a very complex book that encompasses many years.  The movie did a very good job of keying in on the events that allows someone who never read the book to understand the characters, situation and message.  One of mine and my husband's favorites (book and movie).  Laura in Texas
 One of my favorite movies of all time. James Caviezel is excellent in his role as the count. Set on revenge for a serious injustice he ends up with some good fortune that runs his way while in prison. Sets the rest of the movie to plot against the very men that caused his demise. Great Movie!
 We always enjoy seeing this adaptation of the Dumas' book.  The movie flows well and the story (though familiar) is interesting and exciting.  The story, "The Count of Monte Cristo", inspired other great works and movies such as the movie, "The Shawshank Redemption"- one of the best films of all time.  This movie will appeal to all ages.  Great movie.  JR Felisilda Author of the book "Nanay
 having read this book in grade school, it made a huge impression on me... so how great to find this film three decades later and share with my daughter. thought the execution was fantastic, and the departures from the script did not bother me, though i do plan to grab a copy of the book and re-read it.  highly recommended.
 I realize that this movie is different than the book. I have read the book and I loved it.  However, that being said, this movie, standing alone, is AMAZING. I cannot complain. Every time I watch it, reading is the last thing from my mind. This has all the elements of a good action movie- a fantastic intrigue, believable and fun characters, lots of exciting twists and turns and action sequences, a solid and sweet romance, revenge, sword fights, smugglers, mercenaries... I could just go on and on.  I have seen this movie so many times and will watch it so many times again. I wish Hollywood could make more movies like THIS one. I rarely get to see a good old-fashioned historical epic that I love like this.  I refuse to dislike it because it's so different than the book. I think it's an interesting and modern take on a classic story of revenge. I feel the SPIRIT of the novel the entire time I watch the movie, and that's what matters to me.  I just want to say this movie had an EXCELLENT cast and I think that's what helped make the movie so amazing for me. It was the delivery of the lines and the timing of the actors that made it glide so smoothly. I felt like the ACTORS believed the story and were really committed.  In a small but much-needed part, Michael Wincott is perfect in his role as the prison overseer. I love him as an addition to any movie I've seen him in (this role reminded me of his part as Sir Guy in Robin Hood- another amazing part). Of course, Richard Harris as Priest was as perfect as over and very animated! Guy Peace has fun with his role as Fernand- he is so delightfully sarcastic, arrogant and manipulative. Though he played his vulnerable side so well. Luis Guzman and JB Blanc should also get recognized for making this actual revenge plot of this movie happen- they are involved as mercenaries and friends of the count in almost every revenge scene. They are both funny, interesting and believable in their roles. James Caviezel stole my heart away as Edmond... he really played the transition of the character SO well, both in emotions and in the age of the character. I could hardly recognize Edmond as the Count from Edmond the innocent youth. Also, Dagmara Dominczyk was fantastic, though admittedly, I know little about her. I must say, she was given a sappy part (she cries in most of her scenes) and she handled that demanding role well! She was beautiful and sweet. James Frain is one of my all-time favorite actors, though he is not a megastar. I simply adore his acting. He plays a gray villain in this movie- not quite a total bad guy but certainly has his share of bad deeds. It was fun to see him in this part for sure. At first I was surprised at him being casted for that role, but I just came to love the part.  Give this movie a try and just sit back and enjoy. The plot is solid and just complex enough. The acting is superb. It is not a perfect recreation of the original novel but it IS a perfect capture of the IDEA of the novel. Revenge was never so sweet!
 My order was shipped so quickly, it was great. I received the movie with no complications which is not always true when ordering things off the internet.
 This movie is a classic - the perfect combination of action/adventure, intrigue, and romance. It's amazing.
 My brother suggested we watch this.  Normally I don't care for his  movie choices because he loves Star Trek and action films.  WOW, this is a  GREAT MOVIE. I think the only reason anyone would give it less than ten stars 
 This story, written by Alexandre Dumas tells a tale that is as classic and contemporary at the same time as it likely was upon its release as a book in Paris in the 1800s. It is also a tale that almost anyone might find something of value in which to identify. There is innocence, intrigue, revenge, honesty, romance, devotion and narcissism among other personality traits, for good or bad, and clarity around some of the same topics and moral questions experienced by the many vivid characters in this drama. When innocent people go to jail as a result of corruption and a love of materialism, who is to fault? As sophisticated as life was in Paris at the time for people of means, it was rife with corruption.  The movie is excellently scripted, wonderfully acted, and truth is, I just can't watch it enough! Everytime I watch it I get something or see something else in the story that hadn't emerged in my mind earlier. Of course, there are several parts of the film that are my favorite-- if you'd care to know one
 I really  appreciated this film on the second viewing. Afterwards, I thought, "Wow, that was really a satisfying, great film to watch. Satisfying, of course, to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale enacted out but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through.  Boy, I hope this comes out on Blu-Ray some day.  Acting-wise, the most fun to watch was Richard Harris as "Priest, the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel, the man (Edmond Dantes) unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie. Harris had some of the best lines in the movie, several very profound statements. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in "The Passion Of The Christ - sermons about believing in God! That's the acting profession; one film you play an  atheist, the next you are Jesus!  For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow, stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison. Shortly afterward, he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch, played by Luis Gusman, who still sounds like he's more at home in the streets of New York but, once again, you suspend belief and just go along for the ride.  Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do, but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing, making enjoyable films like this. To be fair, it isn't just revenge, as this film points out, it's "justice we all like to see. In here, the two words are interchanged, depending upon one's rationalizations.
 This movie is top notch. The acting and filming is excellent, as is the story line. It conveys a message of hope, eventual justice, the futility of grudge-bearing and the merits of generousity. The action is attention holding and the movie has no dull spots. I watch it on average once per month.
 One of the best Movies I have seen in many years. Jim Caviezal will become a national treasure. Up there with Morgan Freeman,Hoffman,Redford etc. If you want to see a great movie and one to add to a collection this is it.  Brian  cleveland ohio.
 This is one of my favorite versions of the count of Monte-Cristo! I just love (James Caviezel) as Edmund Dantes; he is a beautiful, handsome man! If you love hidden treasure, pirates and seaman, and adventure, and romance, then this movie is just for you!  I highly recommend this movie, it is a story about a poor, innocent and handsome seaman, who gets charged with a crime that he did not commit! His rich best friend Mondego, betrays Edmund, with the help of Dangler(the ships first mate) they are very jealous of Edmund.   Villefort, a powerful and deceitful man joins forces with Mondego, and puts Edmund in prison, and charges Edmund with crimes that he did not commit! Mondego ends up marrying Edmunds sweetheart(Mercedes), while Edmund is in prison.  After several years in prison, Edmund becomes bitter and seeks revenge, and with the help of a fellow prisoner (Richard Harris-the priest), Edmund learns how to read and gets a education and learns how to sword fight! The priest helps Edmund escape, and gives him a hidden treasure.  Then Edmund is rich and free! And seeks revenge! I just loved this movie, a definite must see movie!
 It was so easy to buy the DVD I was looking for, The Count of Monte Cristo, on Amazon.com!  Even ColumbiaHouse did not have it!  I entered a search, got instant results, looked at the reviews, chose a seller and ordered a used but "like new", DVD. It arrived in just days and was in perfect condition!  I'm very happy with the seller and with Amazoncom!
 This Buena Vista film version (spoken in English) of the Count of Monte Cristo is a very fast-paced DVD version of Alexander Dumas's novel of the same title. James Caviezel and Guy Pearce's performes are both well-performed.  I could imagine James Caviezel as the Count of Monte Cristo as pictured in Dumas's novel. The remainder of the characters also fitted their roles well, especially Danglars, Villefort, and Mondego.  It is true that this film version is meant to display acting, especially plot sequence. It therefore does not allow the characters time to develop the way that Dumas's book did. However, this film does present most of the major aspects of the book that are most important to remember.  The revenge sequence at the end of the film does GREATLY variate from the book. For example, Villefort is arrested, Danglars is also arrested, and Mondego dies in a duel. This is not exactly what a BBC drama afficianado might want to see, but then again, no one has ever accused Buena Vista of attempting to mimic the BBC.  Overall, if you want to watch the book on DVD, I would advise you NOT to purchase this DVD. However, if you are willing to watch a film that is relatively entertaining, with good acting and well-designed sets (yet not altogether loyal to Dumas), than this might be the film version for you.  Otherwise, the Koch Lorber Films French version of the Count of Monte Cristo (1999), starring Gerard Depardieu might serve your purpose better - especially if you know how to converse well in Francais (French).
 This is one of my favorite movies. Granted it was only released four years ago and I've probably seen it 4-5 times. I find, not necessarily in this order, a strong sense of fidelity to the original book. While this may seem faint praise, when you compare it to the disasters of Musketeers and Iron Mask, this film is brilliant.  The movie addresses the intrigue of the time. The Bonapartists, the Republicans, and of course the Star Chamber proceedings absent witnesses and certainly absent justice.  Edmund Dantes is imprisoned not for something he did but for something he knows. And the prosecuutor who sentences him conspires with Dantes' friend to arrange a Hitchcockian 'man on the train' exchange of murder most foul, Villafort sentencing the unknowing Dantes to life or death in Chateau d'Iff, a watery prison-grave and Mondego, lusting after Dantes' bethrothed, Mercedes, to murder his Villafort's father, an embarrassing Bonapartist.  The movie reeks of post revolutionary Paris and you get a palpable sense of the times. Dangerous times, but times when a man of revenge and money might make his way.  We feel for Dantes once he escapes from prison, on the one hand rooting for his victory while on the other, saddened by his consumption of hate. Even Mercedes asks him to relinquish his hate and he tells her, surrounded by wealth, 'it's all I have.'  Caviezel is brilliant as the brooding wronged man, articulate and well trained by his colleague in prison, Father Faria (Richard Harris), with his rage and torture so very close to the surface.  Guy Pearce is excellent as the promiscuous, unscrupulous Mondego, and kudos must be given to Luis Guzman, who is always good, and Harris, who is always brilliant.  You can't miss. 5 stars.

 This movie is really good. It is a little long, but it is totally worth it. It's exciting, emotional, dramatic, and captivating. Everyone should see this one!
 Director Kevin Reynolds keeps you pleasantly entertained with light humor in the classic story of the Count of Monte Cristo. I look forward to seeing this movie again.
 I must confess that I have not read the book that this movie is based on.  I did enjoy the few Dumas stories I have read, though.  Most people that give this movie a big thumbs down have read the book and, rather unrealistically, expect a perfect translation of a 900+ page book into a film with a run time of just over 2 hours.  Obviously, that's not going to happen.  So I'll just tackle the film itself. The Count of Monte Cristo hit the theaters in early 2002, arriving with all the fanfare of...well, you know when the grocery store gets a new shipment of cereal?  Less than that.  But sometimes the smallest splashes result in the greatest impacts.  The Count of Monte Cristo came out and reminded the few who saw it that a movie can have a great, cohesive story with superior acting and entertain without being either pretentiously arty or exceptionally lowbrow.  As I said, all of the actors are great
 This is the first time I have preferred a movie over the book on which it was based, something I thought would never happen. The movie is only loosely based on the Dumas novel. Some reviewers have complained that the movie is not true to the book. It would be impossible to make it true to the book in a two-hour period. There are so many subplots in the book's 118 chapters that a movie would have to be several hours long to portray it faithfully.  While I loved the book, I actually liked some of the departures from the original storyline. When reading the book I wanted to sympathize with Edmond but found it harder as the story went on. In the book Edmond in the end is a rather unlikable, arrogant character (despite the good he does). In the movie he regains the decency he had before his imprisonment. In the book he abandons Mercedes to a life of loneliness despite her obvious love for him and settles down with a girl young enough to be his daughter. In the movie he reunites with Mercedes. In the book he harms people who were not responsible for what happened to him and doesn't care about consequences until a woman and child end up dead as a result of his behavior. In the movie he metes out justice and harms only the people who deserve it. The movie is a great moral tale, a great struggle between good and evil. In the book the line between good guy and bad guy is blurred, and Edmond becomes, in many ways, no better than Fernand, Danglars and Villefort. By removing the moral ambiguity I feel that the screenwriters have actually improved on what Dumas wrote, which is rare for film adaptations. This appears to be a fairly low budget movie, so be prepared for some imperfections, such as the lack of great background music that I would have expected of a period piece. I also agree with some reviewers that Fernand was miscast. Having said that I still highly recommend buying this movie.
 There is simply no other word to describe the newest visual version of this great classic but Magnificent!  The Count has always been one of my favorite literary characters and he is brought to life -- a true storybook treatment of the original novel.  The scenery, sets, direction, cinematography and every other aspect of this film are beyond comparison with any other movie my husband and I have seen in the past several years.   The movie sweeps the viewer away from the very first moments, incorporating historical characters and events into a story which develops and broadens as the movie progresses.  On the night I saw this film (my birthday -- my choice), I had received a painful shot to ease torn muscle pain in my arm.  My husband and I really debated whether we wanted to go out at all simply because I wasn't in the mood to do anything.  But I had so wanted to see this movie since I first saw the previews that I decided to brave it (we already had a sitter lined up too).  By the time the movie was 15 minutes in, I had forgotten the pain, relaxed back in my seat and was totally enthralled.   We are very picky about the movies we go to see and have not been overly impressed of late with the selections available.  We would usually rather stay home and watch one of our 2000+ VHS tapes or growing collection of DVDs.  This film was so incredible, we went back 11 days later and saw it again (something we never do except occasionally with Star Trek movies).  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes romance, action, adventure, period pieces and tremendous storytelling.
 The movie was very different from the book but it was a very good movie with excellent acting. It was worth watching.
 This is a wonderful retelling of Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo. James Caviezel plays a wonderful Edmund Dantes, and a mysterious Count Of Monte Cristo.
 This is one of my favorite movies!  That's why I bought it.
 A movie worth watching numerous times.  An excellent cast which contributes complexity and depth to this historical fiction classic.  The movie excels at various levels.  It will remain as one of our family's all time favorites.  Everyone we have shown the movie to, in turn, snatches my movie and shows the movie to others.  I have purchased additional copies.  Appropriate for various audiences.  Tasteful and timely humor.  Not one expletive.  Eloquently executed.  Exciting and satisfying resolution.
 This is one of the best revenge movies I have ever seen.  If you never see a movie again except for this one, you will be just fine.  Good Plot, Great Action, and a story to die for.
 We've seen many of these revenge movies and the COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is a compilation of them all. Oh, and throw in a little of the illiterate and naive country bumpkin who becomes educated by the kindly older gentleman during an undeserved incarceration and we have a great film. This movie is reminiscent of Zorro, Pirates of the Caribbean and all the good swashbucklers that we have come to enjoy. James Caviezel does an outstanding job of playing Edmund Dantes, the honorable and kindly young man who is wrongfully accused of treason by his jealous best friend.  Abb' Faria (the delightful Richard Harris), another prisoner befriends Dantes during the thirteen years he is imprisoned.  This priest not only educates Dante, but also gives him a map to a great treasure. When Dantes escapes he finds the treasure and then begins his quest of retaliation against those who betrayed him. We all like vengeance movies where the 'bad guy' gets theirs and MONTE CRISTO is one of the best! The scenery, costumes and acting are all top notch and the little love story is also highly enjoyable.
 I absolutely loved this movie! The music, the story, everything.  Of course, James Caviezel was gorgeous. And, Guy Pearce was a real looker too. Movies are so much fun when there is a bad guy who is just rotten to the core. Don't you just love when there is a villain you can just hate and enjoy hating? Each bad guy got what he deserved, and they got it good! The humor was priceless. This is a flawless movie. So, it's not the original. BIG DEAL! He got the women, the kid, and some sweet revenge. If that doesn't make a good movie I don't know what does. The original didn't have any of that. Did I mention that the action was delicious? And, that sword fight at the end was quite enjoyable. All I can say is if you haven't seen this one you don't know what you're missing!
 Many reviewers have commented on the movie so I'd like to focus exclusively on the features of the DVD. So many times you you get a DVD and the  extras  consist of the trailer and the choice of sub-titles.  Other times you luck out and get what appears to be cool behind-the-scenes documentaries.  What you get, in fact, are hammy interviews with the cast and crew as they go about their business of making the movie.  And most of the explanations of the more technical aspects are as about as in-depth as you'd get on Entertainment Tonight.   There are exceptions, of course, such as the first Matrix which offered details about how they created the special effects in the movie.  But it seems these kinds of extras are the exception and not the rule. The Count of Monte Cristo is a pleasant surprise because it truly offers interesting background information that a fan of the movie would want to watch.   A discussion with the screenwriter as to how and why he adapted the script from the original Dumas book was very interesting.  And the short bio on Dumas was a nice surpise.  And unlike other DVDs, this one offers not only deleted scenes, but also commentary about why those scenes were deleted.  Perhaps the only mundane portion of the extras was the  layer-by-layer  audio design segment which took a specific scene of the movie and split the sound into dialogue, sound effects, and music.  But even then, this would be of interest to people who want to learn more about how movies are made. This is a DVD for people who want to know more about the movie and its subject.  I only wish other DVDs were as good as this one.
 Perhaps one of the best novels ever written, the Count of Monte Cristo is a story of an innocent man that seeks to revenge his wrongful imprisonment.  Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.   Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly.  This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).   Truly a classic and a must read.
 I never heard of this movie until someone mentioned he was named after the Dumas character in this novel.  I haven't watched the 1934 version but I have the TV miniseries with Gerard Depardieu [in French with English subtitles] and this latest version.  Of the two, the movie was definitely a notch above [both due to the choice of actor and the screenplay adaptation].  I just wished I watched it with the someone beside me!
 If you have read this classic tale by Alex Dumas, you won't be disappointed! This is a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up until the very end! It will exceed your expectations, I promise you! Jim Caviezel makes a great Dantes and Pearce's dialogue is truly amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 I read the novel this summer, in anticipation for the release of this movie and after watching the film, I realized that the movie can stand on its own merits.  At times, however, my knowledge of the novel did cloud my perspective of the film, but the quality of the acting, the scenery, and the storyline is much higher than the majority of Hollywood films.  I strongly recommend both the film and the book. Yes, there is liberty taken in adapting the classic book to the screen, but you simply cannot portray the complexity of the novel in a 2-hour time frame. This is a great movie, and Dumas' classic novel is a great book. No question about it.
 Never heard of this movie until my husband brought it home.  It was wonderful!  Thoroughly enjoyable this tale of a wronged man who takes sweet revenge on his enemies, while reigniting a lost love. Why have I never heard of this film before? Surely the lead should have been nominated for an Oscar.  This film was a little violent, but can be enjoyed by the entire family.  A true gem.
 I wrote a review for this DVD, but it never got posted for some reason.  I gave it one star because I was under the impression that this was going to be released in FULLSCREEN only.  At least, that's what was listed on this page.  But now, I look on this page and it says WIDESCREEN format.  YES!  PHEW!  Okay, now I WILL buy this movie, because  it is an excellent one.  And looking at the special features listed, the DVD itself looks promising. I will most likely write another review once I get the DVD and am able to explore the special features.  Just wanted to say how glad I am to find out that the whole FULLSCREEN situation was a terrible mix up.  I just hope that THIS isn't another typo.
 "The Count of Monte Cristo is a lavish adaptation of the 1845 Alexander Dumas novel. The film stars Jim Caviezel as Dantes, a sailor framed for treason by his supposed best friend, Fernand (Guy Pearce). But why would anyone frame his best friend for treason? Well, poverty stricken Dantes has something rich and powerful Fernand does not; love. Fernand wants Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk); Dantes true love, for himself. Thus, Fernand concocts an evil setup, framing Dantes for treason. Dantes is then imprisoned on the cruel island prison of Chateau D'lf for 13 years, where he transforms from a lighthearted sailor to a bitter and angry man. While at Chateau D'lf, he plots revenge against those who betrayed him. Richard Harris also puts forth a quality performance as Abb&eacute; Faria, another innocent prisoner. With the help of this strange old man, Dantes escapes the island and transforms himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo after following an old treasure map to a load of treasure on the island of Monte Cristo (thus the "Count of Monte Cristo). Becoming rich and powerful is the first step in Dantes revenge. "The Count of Monte Cristo is such an enjoyable film mainly because of the sweet satisfaction involved in watching Dantes execute his revenge on Fernand. Revenge is always an exciting thing to watch! The audience is able to identify with Dantes and sympathize with him. You may even find yourself becoming as obsessed over exacting revenge as Dantes! My point is; you are really drawn into the story, more so that any film in recent memory. "The Count of Monte Cristo brings in some intriguing aspects of Dantes personality about midway through the film. When Dantes returns as The Count of Monte Cristo, he sees that he could have a perfect life if he wanted to. His love, Mercedes, still wants to be with him and he now has all the money he could ever need. Yet Dantes pushes it all away. He must complete his revenge. It has now become clear that Dantes has become obsessed and can no longer look at the world in a rational way. It's really quite painful to see what Dantes has become. "The Count of Monte Cristo boasts an intelligent screenplay, lavish sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, superb action sequences, beautiful music, superb directing and stellar acting.
 I was blown away by the incredible adaptation of a familiar tale.  Jim Caveziel was hauntingly sensitive, only to turn fearfully vengeful.  His nemesis, and former best friend, Guy Pearce, hinted at a carefully concealed malice before indulging in a fearsome betrayal.  Everything in this film works. The sword play in this Alexandre Dumas swashbuckler is awesome.  The sets, the costumes, all combine to seduce the viewer.  Furthermore, the DVD extras are excellent, both informative and entertaining.  I can remember Richard Chamberlain's Count from the 70's, I believe, and I did not expect to ever see a better one.  But I was wrong.  This film is better.  A definite must-see,which I somehow missed when it was released.
 I recently watched this show at the movie theater that gets all the movies later and charges [a cheaper rate] to watch them.  Well, because of that, I just recently saw this movie.  In fact, I saw it the day before I watched Star Wars Episode II, and a bit after seeing Harry Potter, and Spiderman.  Well, of all these films, The Count of Monte Cristo was the best!  Funny how my original expectations kept me from watching it as a new release...  Highly recommended!
 i would just like to say wake up it is a movie. even though it does not go along with the book it is still a good one.  who cares about it matching the book. alot of movies don't match the book. and movies that match the book are not exciting any way you already know what is going to happen yea!!! if you know already why do you need to see a movie about it. get over yourselves.  i personally think that this movie had a great ending and not to mention some really hot guys.  watch a movie to watch a new good movie not to watch a redo of an old book.
 I have used the DVD  The Counte Of Monte Cristo  in religion class to give the teenage students a deeper understanding about 'Sins' and 'Virtues'. The character of Fernand Mondego is an example of a sinful man who is filled with
 This is a great if somewhat inaccurate rendition of the book by Alexander Dumas. The disc arrived in the condition described and very quickly. I am happy.
 This was a gift to my boss. A favorite movie but he & his spouse could not find their copy. They would reach for the movie & find an empty case. Ever happen to you? They were both thrilled to get the video. I was happy that it came perfectly on time for the Christmas holiday.
 I love, love, love this movie!  The acting is superb, especially the relationship between Edmond and the priest.  This movie has it all - romance, friendship, family, betrayal, murder, prison, escape, love, poverty, wealth, etc.  I've watched this at least 20 times and will watch it again someday soon.
 I'll start off by saying that the book is one of my all-time favorites and is well worth the read.  But don't expect the movie to exactly copy the book.  The book contains far too much detail and plot turns to allow it all into a movie that could be viewed in one sitting, so why even bother to try?  The movie starts with the same premise as the book, it veers off into a new and refreshing direction.  While it retains the same flavor, it differs in many of the details.  The result is a wonderful story, optimized for the screen, that keeps those who know the story well very entertained and not quite sure what's coming next.  Jim Caviezel's performance in this movie is excellence in acting.  He displays the misery and agony well when needed, then moves onto a focused, calculated and emotionally-repressed Count.  Excellent acting in one of the most difficult roles imaginable - right up his alley.  Luis Guzman's Jacapo makes the movie.  The role of the character in the movie does an excellent job of helping to "explain the Count efficiently.  Nearly each line that comes from Guzman's mouth is memorable - the quality of his performance alone would have overwhelmed many lesser movies.  The action, effects, score and other items that you'd expect from Hollywood are all there - in sufficient quantity without overwhelming the viewer.  It definitely should have swept the awards in 2002!!
 This is a beautifully done rendition of the classic. This screen adaptation is better I think than the novel. The screen version has a more cohesive plot and it has a happier ending.  It is a great family movie despite the sword fights and other intense scenes of violence. There is a lot of humor and romance but there are serious lessons taught as well without being preachy. My children range from age 10 to 17 and they all love it and quote from it all the time. This recent purchase was a gift. We have gifted several copies. It is one of our favorite movies.
 This film has the eye candy of it's era along with the "easy on the eyes Jim Caviezel! This man can not only act but wow can he reach down into your very being to touch you with his roles. I saw him in the movies; Frequency and Angel Eyes before this and he just keeps getting better!! He is a ladies heart throb and man's man all rolled into one. My husband took me to see this and also found this film to be a truly entertaining film from a man's point of view.
 item ordered was in excellent condition and sent within time specified.  Very satisfied
 A timeless masterpiece! A great story with terrific actors, brilliant dialogue in a beautiful location. Both Dantes (Jim Caviezel) as well as his evil friend, Mondego (Guy Pearce) were outstanding. Also the close relationship between Dantes and the Priest (Richard Harris) so touching. And who could forget Jacopo (Luis Guzman)?! Everyone I have shown this film to  (young to old) love it. You will not be disappointed!
 The movie came in quicker than I expected and I am very pleased with the results
 Best movies I have purchased.... betrayal, deception and the power of love.... wow worth the cost ***********
 Cool action movie.  The ultimate revenge.  After wrongly suffering 11 years imprisoned, Caveziel plans retribution for his alledged best friend whose jealousy forces him too far.  Some elements are unbelievable...an old priest teaching sword fighting, a lucky treasure map leading to abundant riches, everything falling into place perfectly, but who cares...it was a lot of fun and great to see the count win out over his jealous nemesis.
 An excellent movie. Exceptional performances by entire cast especially Caviezel and Richard Harris. Intriging and moving. Have watched it several times.
 I owned this DVD from the time it came out, but finally just got around to watching it. I was interested to see more films with James Caviezel after watching  THE PASSION . I am go glad to have finally taken the time to see it. The DVD was great and this is definitely one that I'm glad to have in my very extensive collection!!! If you haven't taken the time to see this before now, then by ALL means, do so! You will not regret it, and I guanrantee the time will fly!!
 Just watched a screening of Count of Monte Cristo and I thought it was an excellent movie! It had all the ingredients--suspense, action and romance! The acting was quite good too, especially Jim Caviezel, who played the Count of Monte Cristo. It was very entertaining at all levels.  I actually felt that I would pay to watch the movie again at the theatres.  It was fast paced and not slow going at all. Jim Caviezel was just excellent in the role of Edmond Dantes (Count of Monte Cristo).  I myself could not image another person playing him.  Guy Pearce was a formidable villian.  Henry Caville was excellent as the son of Fernand, Albert, as was Dagmara Dominiczyk, who played Mercedes, the finance of Dantes.  The scenary was breathtaking and Caviezel's grand entrance was one of the best parts of the movie, next to his days at the Chateau d'If.  Go watch this movie!!!!!!! Then, read the book after, even though there will be differences, the movie holds on its own, as will the novel.
 I will first adress the book then move on to the movie.  For anyone who has read this book, and i mean the 1462 page book, which is the longest book i have ever read, you would find it much different than the movie. For better or for worse?  The MOVIE has a better STORY in my opinion. Why? Because they improved on the faults of Dumas's since he couldnt finish this book. After reading around 1100 pages and nearing the end, i started to see the book i found so great, start to fade into something just "good". Could it be to Dumas tiring of writing the book? or a demand for an ending, which thus rushed the ending into something flat and not as great as 3/4 of the book was.  If you have the read the unabridged book as i have, you may have been disapointed to find that Characters like Franz and Albert had no real ending stories, whereas Maximilian ends the story and for god knows what reason, Dumas spent so many wasted pages about Franz.  To spend so much time and effort, dumas fell short. If he had added another 3-4 chapters near the end, he could of made the story "Great". (whats another 3-4 chapters to you when its 117 chapters...) Instead he wasted too much time on meaningless pages half way through the book and gives hints about albert being his son but never clarifies it. The ending with Mercedez was rather weak and short (in the book) and so was it with haydee. Not impressed... since a book doesnt need so many pages to make it a great one. Too many Books i prefer over this one.  Now...  The MOVIE, Count of Monte Cristo, excels where the book could not. It gives a better "story overall. It takes all the good parts of the book and compacts it into a couple well good watched hours. Though i do say "hollywood exagerates the prison part of Dantes being whipped, where in the book he is well treated. But thats showbiz for ya. The movie has a better ending in my opinion. It is sad but uplifting, whereas in the book it is sad, sad, sad, like a shakespeare book. ;(  I dont think this Movie gets as much appreciation as it should. The movie is well adapted from the book, unlike so many "book to movie films.  To anyone who has read the entire book and seen this movie and thinks the movie was bad, but the book was good.... You should try and take sometime to appreciate how hard it is to take a book that is 1400 pages long and put it into a 2 hour movie. Love to see you try and make a better movie.  So i will conclude that altough the book was good, the movie was better and Dumas would have been thrilled to know such a good interpertation was put out for the masses to watch, since few have the patience to read the entire book. If you have not seen this movie but have heard of the story before, i would recommend you see this as it is one of the greatest adventure stories of all time.
 This is one of my all time favorite movies. No, I have not read the book yet, but, luckily, that means I can appriciate the movie for what it is, rather than what it is not. This movie was highly entertaining. It has action, drama, supense, romance, and comedy. The acting was very well done (Brownie Points for having Luis Guzman?, Richard Harris, and the Guy with the really awesome voice) and the visuals were spectacular.
 This 2002 film brings the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas to the screen with a swashbuckling intensity that starts at the beginning and never lets up.  It's set in France at the beginning of the 19th Century and tells the tale of a young man, falsely imprisoned because of his friend's betrayal, who escapes and eventually has his revenge.  Of course it's more complicated than that.  There are ups and downs and twists of fate.  There is swordplay and hidden treasures and pirates and secrets unfolded.  And it's all wrapped up in a package that swept me up in the story and held me captive till the end. Jim Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes who has the misfortune to have Fernand Mondego, played by Guy Pearce, as a friend.  When Dantes is betrayed, he is sentenced to an unlimited amount of time in a terrible prison where he lives in solitary confinement and gets whipped once a year.  The years pass, his clothes grow ragged, his hair grows longer and his despondency increases.  Then, one day, another prisoner, Abbe Faria, played by Richard Harris, tunnels his way into Dantes' room.  Abbe Faria is old, but he has hope.  And together they plan their escape.  All they have to do is spend the next eight years digging another tunnel.  In the meantime, Faria teaches his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; to read and write.  He also teaches him to use a sword.  Eventually, as they make their escape, the old man dies, but not before he gives Dantes a map to hidden treasure. The story now takes a different turn because the treasure that is found allows Dantes to become The Count of Monte Cristo, return to his home town and exact revenge on Fernand Mondego, who is now married to Mercedes, played by Dagmara Dominczyk, who was once Dantes' sweetheart.  The acting was excellent, the cinematography outstanding and the story wonderful.  And, because I saw it on DVD, the extras made the experience of watching this film even better.  There's a short history of Alexandre Dumas, who was of Caribbean heritage and one of the most prolific authors of his time.  There's a interview with the screenwriter who talked about the difficulty of adapting this classic and explained exactly why he made certain changes in the story. There's a section that shows the actors learning the art of fencing.  And a section that shows how the sets were built.  These extras were like icing on a cake and certainly enhanced the experience of the film. I loved it.  And highly recommend it.  Especially the DVD version.
 Like the previous reviewer, I too was fortunate enough to catch this last Tuesday at a sneak preview in NY.  This was simply magnificent in every possible way. The acting, script, cinematography were stunning.  I just want to say something
 I love Jim Caviezel in this movie and it's become one of my favorites. It's got drama, a love story, and some action so that you and your spouse can both enjoy it together. I would recommend not allowing young children to watch this movie as it can be violent in spots though. The great thing about this movie is the underlying morals it encompasses. Dantes (played by Jim Caviezel) has every right for revenge for being imprisoned unjustly for 13 years.  Dantes learns an internal strength  and you will feel "gripped as you follow his emotions from sadness, bitterness, anger, shock, and forgiveness as life continues to change for him in varied ways. You will root for Dantes, cry with him,  smile, and feel justified at the ending.
 Being an extremely picky movie critic myself, I feel obligated to provide my own two cents when I find the critics completely wrong.  I usually heed the warnings of critics, and even though the Count of Monte Cristo received mixed to poor reviews, I went ahead and saw it anyway.  This movie was a friendly reminder that if you listen to the critics all the time, you might just miss out on something. This was a great movie.  The two hours flew by, I didn't find a dull moment, and while the humor was a touch on the corny side, I feel it actually benefited the movie.  I'm not saying I didn't have any problems with the movie (slightly melodramatic lead-in to ending) but I came out happy and fulfilled.  I wasn't the only one, either.  The whole audience seemed to laugh, gasp and cheer together, proving that other people besides myself enjoyed the Count of Monte Cristo as well. See it yourself and make up your own mind.
 I was partway through the rantings of another reviewer about how much this movie strayed from a classic.  And how bad this adaptation was.  But you know what?  I don't really care.  I haven't read the book, and I likely won't.  I happen to like the film.  It has a decent plot, good actors and a theme someone simple-minded as myself can understand - "revenge".  How often have we felt cheated in our lives?  How often have we felt that we are the underdogs?  This film shows us that good things will come to those who wait.  That revenge is sweetest when it is well thought out and exacted with a fury. In this story a sailer by the name of Edmond Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned when his best friend Fernand betrays  him in order to steal his wife.  In prison, Edmond is about to lose hope when a fellow inmate teaches him how to read/write/fight and escape from prison.  At his dying breath, he tells Edmond of a buried treasure that he should use to do good.  Edmond, however, has other thoughts in his mind.  Edmond transforms himself into the mysterious and wealthy Count of Monte Cristo.  With systematic planning, he cleverly inserts himself into high society and exacts revenge from his enemies of the past.  His goal is not to kill them, but to humiliate them and let them know what it feels like to have nothing left to live for. ...  The movie was fun to watch, so watch it.
 Over the past several years the works of Alexander Dumas have been continually butchered on the big screen.  Disney's The Three Musketeers was more interested in laughs than in the story, 1998's The Man in the Iron Mask was just a little off and modern to be Dumas, and it would be better to ignore the ignoble film The Musketeer.  Kevin Reynolds' The Count of Monte Cristo perfectly captured the spirit of the Dumas classic.  Jim Caviezal makes a perfect Edmund Dantes while Guy Pearce is the perfect foil as the monster Count Fernand Mondego.  The acting is superb the story of revenge and redemption is excellent and although dark at times, Reynolds keeps the film moving and captures the elaborate Dantes revenge perfectly.  I give this film high marks and it honors the spirit of the Dumas novel perfectly.
 I found the movie to be compelling interesting and totally unlike any other movie ive seen, that is the reason I read the book, I didnt like the book I found it to be very very dry, its stupid to say that you dont like the movie, what did you expect. If your a fan of a book its your job not to like the movie, Thats why I anticipate that both Ender's Game and the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy are both going to be terrible. Moral to the story Anticipate the worse that way you wont be disapointed.
 I thought Jim Caviezel was an exceptionally great Count of Mounte Christo. He really comes through in the three arcs of Edmond Dantes, his performance is right on as the wronged and then vengeful yet tormented mysterious stranger who takes high society Paris by storm. I am not sure, going by the Director's commentary, if he was a perfect mesh personality wise to the Director's natural rhythmes ( who has made a steller film in this work) & i am not sure if the Director was totally happy with his lead's way with the character or at least found it a bit baffling at times, but i think it was a great combination and is part of what lift's this film into a longterm charismatic classic.  The other leads and support roles are all just as good, which with interesting sub-plots here and there, never lets go of one's interest in this great unfolding & rather special drama adaption.  The story itself has some pay offs & set-ups that are not as full as they could have been, yet this doesn't take from the film one iota because it has so much else that gives it great depth, from performances, production values and direction, & the right kind of humor balance to splendid emotive beats through out the film.  Great sets, writing, photography, sense of 18th century adventure, plot and intense acting all help draw u in to the drama of romance, skull duggary and revenge. So the film has all the elements woven together in a way which is highly enjoyable, while also containing it's own unique special spark.
 You don't have to cover your kids eyes while watching this movie. And in these times, that is very rare.  The story for this movie is very good. It has a lot of character developement. You watch the star go from a poor, uneducated peasant to a wealthy count, and he uses his wealth to get revenge on those who got him imprisoned in jail for the past 11 years. If you liked Frequency, or The Time Machine (same actors), then you'll enjoy this movie.
 Jim Caviezel I love you.  What one does with money is only a reflection of what's in your heart.  Your true heart came out at the end.  Money is a tool.  Venenge is man's spirtual currency.  Restoration is God's.  In the end, God always wins.  Choose your side wisely.
 The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best movies of this type (classic literature for the MTV age).  I love it, and I teach high school English.  While it is true that the movie sometimes strays far from the book, it still holds the same ideals of revenge, forgiveness, and faith.  Fabulous!
 This is such a marvelous rendition of Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo that even my beloved, but red-necked, son-in-law liked it.  Full of swash and buckle, intrigue and suspense, this movie even has tender love scenes thrown in for the ladies.  Good guys win, bad guys pay, and the lady gets her man. The period piece costuming is well done.  All of the fight scenes are believable with no acrobatics spoiling the credibility.  And when it comes time for the bad guy to get what is coming to him, you are cheering.  It is entertaining while cleverly promoting morals such as education is a virtue, all things come to he who waits, and best of all - vengeance is a dish best served cold!
 This is a great story of the Count of Monte Christo and how he became the count via the betrayal of a close friend and the tutoring of 'the prist' in prison.  Very inspiring movie I would recommend without any reservation.
 I LOVE THIS MOVIE & HAVE ALWAYS  WANTED TO BUY IT.  THE QUALITY OF THE PURCHASE IS GREAT! THANK YOU MRS. LAYOW
 I had been searching for a blu-ray copy of The Count of Monte Cristo and had given up.  Luckily, Amazon sends me messages when their DVDs are on sale.  This last time, there it was!  Thanks, Amazon!
 This movie was better than I had ever expected, well worth the adding to your collection.
 The Count of Monte Cristo is an entertaining film that we saw in the theater and then bought for home viewing.  We like it so much that, when we couldn't locate the VHS tape that we purchased, we bought a DVD copy to replace it.  We enjoy watching it again and again.
 James Caviezel and Guy Pearce bring "The Count of Monte Cristo book to life! This movie is great from beginning to end. I'd been meaning to see it for 3 years now and finally had the chance to watch it last night. The acting, the cinematography, the script, the beautiful Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), make this movie a top 100 on mine and any other movies fan's list! I could not take my eyes off the screen. I kept wanting to see more and more as i didn't know what would happen next. I guess never having read the book has its advantages lol!!
 A man named Dantes is about to be married to the woman he loves. Only one problem
 Loved Loved Loved this movie!!!!!  I can watch it over and over and over again. With the price of DVDs you need to find movies that you can watch over and over again.
 This is an excellent movie.  Even though it is  a typical Holly Wood production , it didn't mutilate the plot so much you couldn't even recognize the title of it.  Edmond Dantes is protrayed perfectly but Mercedes' actress doesn't look like the real Mercedes.  The film shows every thing that gets the theme of the book across, and the changes made fall into place.  Even though I had my hands clutched in terror during parts of it,  I still laughed and cried.  It was a wonderful movie and the ending is so sweet.  Even though the book's ending was sweet, this one has the 'happily ever after' part added to it. And all the subplots were eliminated, so were many characters so it is much easier to follow.  And even though the film goes by so fast, the actions of the characters results in a lot of development.
 I love this Movie!  Totally Addicted to it!  It actually has a plot that keeps you glued to the screen without machine guns or 5800 unnecessary boob shots! LOL I watch it at least twice a month. This is the way movies should be instead of that junk in the theaters. Jayce
 Edmond Dantes(Jim Caviezel) and his best friend Fernand ( Guy Pierce) are forced to dock ship to save the life of their captain. Napolean will only offer medical assistance if Edmond delivers a letter from Napolean to Versaille. Little does Edmond know that it contains plans to overthrow the king. When Edmond and Fernand return, Edmond is promoted to captain of the ship and becomes engaged to his one true love Mercedes (Dagmara Domincyzk). Fernand becomes jealous of Edmond's life and he also feels betrayed when he manages to find out about the letter. He turns Edmond into the authorities. Now Edmond is branded a traitor to France and sentenced to life imprisonment in the worst prison imaginable. Mercedes is told by the crown prosecutor that Edmond is dead, and she marries Fernand. While inside, Edmond befriends a priest ( Richard Harris) who educates him, teaches him to fight, and lets him know of a treasure of the Island of Monte Cristo. Edmond promises his friend that he will escape and find the treasure. Edmond finally does after 14 years and uses the treasure to become the Count of Monte Cristo. As the count, Edmond plans to gain revenge on Fernand and the Crown Prosecutor (James Frain), as well as win back Mercedes. Count of Monte Cristo has an amazing story of revenge and love, outstanding acting, and thrilling swashbuckling action that will keep you glued to the screen. Jim Caviezel nails the role of Edmond Dantes to perfection. Guy Pierce does an amazing job as Fernand. His treacherous ways make him the perfect villan. Dagmara Domincyzk does a nice job as Mercedes. I also enjoyed James Frain's performance as the Crown Prosecutor. The best performance has to be by Richard Harris. Harris's portrayal of the priest is excellent. The story itself will keep you glued to the screen from beginning to end and the fighting sequences are top notch. The only problem I had with the film, is that the adaptation did not really follow the book at all. However, the film still manages to be enjoyable, and in some instances, it is even better than the book. The supberb acting, thrilling action sequences, and overall story are responsible for making Count of Monte Cristo one of my all time favorite films. The DVD offers outstanding picture and sound quality, as well as some nice special features as well. This is definately a film that I consider a must own.
 I went to this movie because of two reasons
 I never read the book, so this story was entirely new to me. I loved it. Like all movies, there are a few plot holes but the overall feeling and effect of the film are fantastic. The story centers on a young man wrongfully sent to prison after being betrayed by his best friend for the love of his fiance. The man, long thought dead, spends many years in prison where he meets another inmate. This inmate teaches him to read, write, fight, and gives him the location of a great treasure. The scorned man uses this treasure to regain himself a life and seek out revenge on those responsible for his misery and torture. The plot twists and thickens and keeps you entertained throughout.
 This movie is a wonderful work of art. It should have won an Oscar! The movie is set in France with lush backgrounds and a truly incredible story based on the book by Alexander Dumas. Not only is it a terrific tale of love and survival, it is also a feast for the adventure fan. The Count of Monte Cristo is filled with enough swordfights, daring escapes, and backstabbing comrades to satisfy any viewer. I highly recommend this movie.
 JAmes Caviezel was magnificant and Guy Ritchie also.  I have also seen James C play in High Crimes which he was also very good.  This is the 1st movie that I had recognized Guy Ritchie and thought he was great also.
 I ordered this dvd, it came in the mail quickly, it is in perfect condition (no scratches). We have watched it 3 times already!
 Ok this MOVIE is  amazing. Im tired of these people crying and saying its not the book. Yea its not the book its a MOVIE! Get it threw ur heads, all books are diff from movies. Its a great movie about love,betrayl,revange,what else do you need. The acting was great. And if your bored go read the book but if you want to watch a great MOVIE watch this epic.
 This is simply the best film I have seen since May 6,2000 when I sat down to watch Gladiator. It is absolutely amazing and beyond words. I really thought that this movie would be a farce considering the length of the book and the treatment that was done of "The Three Musketeers back in 1993. But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised at the faithfullness to the text. Yes some things were changed and peripheral characters were left out, however that should be expected since there was no way that the entire contents of a 1091 page book are going to fit into a theatrically realeased movie. The movie is so well done that you don't even care. And trust me I'm a hardcore fan of the COMC, it is one of my top favorite books. The only thing I saw Jim Caviziel in was that Jenifer Lopes flick where he seemed "out of it". For some reason I thought that I would get the same performance in this movie. Not so Caviziel plays Edmond the way I thought that he should be played. First off all as a naive boy, then as the movie progresses you see the anguish he goes through as his innocence has been ripped from him in prison, then to the noble aristocrat with a shimmering rage just underneath the surface. Guy Pearce is excellent as t the perfidious Fernand, and so is James Frain as Villefort. I especially liked Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedes. She and Caviziel had the most amazing chemistry. It was one of the best and most believable romances I have seen on the big screen. The acting, the sets, the costumes and the excellent sword fights truly make this a delight of the senses. I wish that Hollywood would put this kind of stuff out more often. Please see this film believe me you will NOT be disapointed.
 The Count Of Monte Cristo I went to this movie, expecting to see nothing more than a good adventure movie with decent sword fights. Mind you, I did not know of the story of The Count Of Monte Cristo, however I liked many of Alexander Dumas' other stories. What I received from this movie, was an amazing plot line, great sword fights, over the top performances by the entire cast, and simple humor. I was definitely surprised at how simple the filming techniques were compared to many of Hollywood's other recent films, and this made it only better. Probably the best tale of revenge I have ever experienced, The Count Of Monte Cristo will go down in history as one of my favorite movies. I could not stop smiling the entire time, and man did I really hate Guy Pierce! Final Grade
 "The Count of Monte Cristo is a classic tale of betrayal and revenge (which the novel's author, Alexander Dumas, was inspired to write after reading of an incident, broadly similar in its basic aspects, in an essay written by a French police archivist).  The main character, Edmond Dant&egrave;s, is betrayed and falsely accused of treason, subsequently immured in a bleak and cruel prison, where he makes a fortunate acquaintance in the Abb&eacute; Faria, another wrongly accused prisoner, who eventually provides him with the education (both social and martial) and the financial means to exact revenge upon his accusers following his inevitable escape.  Upon achieving his freedom, Dant&egrave;s falls in with a crew of smugglers (giving him the disreputable, underworld connections that will prove so useful to him later), recovers a literal buried treasure bequeathed him by the Abb&eacute; Faria, and assumes the identity of an Italian nobleman, the titular Count of Monte Cristo, which opens the doors of aristocratic Parisian society, thus giving him access to his targets.  He then plots and carries out the downfall of all his enemies.  His revenge achieved, he then resumes his relationship with the beautiful woman to whom he was engaged prior to his arrest.  (In this last part, the movie departs completely from the novel, but I actually like this better; not only did I always feel sorry for Dumas' Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, who lost everything, and went off to live out the remainder of a rather broken, lonely life, but the woman with whom Dant&egrave;s eventually finds love, Hayd&eacute;e, always seemed to me a rather pale, colorless character, who serves little purpose in the story, and seems to exist only to provide Dant&egrave;s with a happy ending.)  This is a film which, if memory serves, did moderately well at the box office, but no more than that.  For the life of me, I simply cannot fathom why that is.  Perhaps it's because it didn't have enough "action.  If that is so, it's a terrible commentary on how audiences' expectations have been dumbed down, and whose attention spans have been shortened by a steady diet of simple-minded action movie blockbusters over the past several decades.  Sure there is only one spectacular fight, but the film needs no more than this (and such things were signally lacking in the novel as well, where Edmond Dant&egrave;s achieve his revenge by plotting and intrigue, not by fisticuffs or swordplay).  I don't think the disappointment of ardent fans of the novel can explain why the film didn't enjoy better success, as I doubt that a majority of film goers these days have actually read all of it.  And I might as well mention, at this point, the harshest criticism that usually gets leveled at this film
 One of my favorite movies!  I know Dumas admirers will strongly disagree, however I believe that this is one of the best adaptations ever.  Usually when Hollywood makes significant changes from the book, the results are horrendous.  Remember The Mists of Avalon?  Seriously, the book is great...one of the greatest and with all due respect, the changes made to the movie do enhance the story.  Some may complain about name changes and missing characters but get over it folks, the book is more than a 1000 pages and something had to be left out.  I don't want to give anything away but I felt that the romantic modifications with the Mercedes character actually improved on the Dumas story.  I always felt that he overly abused this character and I was happy to see her treated with more respect in the movie.  Another thing that I (and my wife) liked about this movie is the fact that it is more plot oriented rather than action oriented.  It is not non-stop sword fighting.  There are many interesting subtle plot details that make this movie a keeper, one that can be watched over and over.  I especially enjoyed the section where Dantes has his awakening of sorts with assistance from the Abbe Faria within the prison.  How many of these elements did you catch the first time that you watched it?  Anyway, some people will bash any movie that does not precisely follow the book and really, this is impossible.  Lord of the Rings is probably the most successful and at 10 hours long, there were still parts left out.  Enjoy this movie and don't let the naysayers keep you from watching arguably the best Dumas adaptation yet.
 First of all, let's get one thing out of the way. This film is an adaptation of a novel and as such it adds some new elements and deletes some others. (Note to book-to-film critics
 I happened to catch this movie on television and loved it so much that I had to buy it.  It is a great story of such well-calculated revenge and the perfect example of "what goes around comes around".  Others have complained that the filmmakers took quite a bit of "artistic freedom in adapting the book to the movie format.  I guess I really don't mind that this was done.  Each individual work -- the book and the movie -- can stand alone as a well-crafted, entertaining story.  Many purists disagree, but that's what's great about reviews
 I found this version more satifyling than the one with Richard Chamberline. Although the Caviezel version does not follow the book, the "boy getting the girl in the end offers more satisfaction
 Director Reynolds fashions a handsome, sweeping, exciting epic that keeps his audience glued in place. Pearce's Fernand is so despicably low, we cannot wait for the long-suffering Edmond to wreak vengeance. In this hugely entertaining picture, revenge is a dish served hot, and adventure fans are sure to feel sated by the end. Also, solid family viewing- with older children.
 I have loved to watch this movie from the day it hit the movie theaters.  I now own it and watch it often.
 One of the best movies I've seen.  Makes me feel good every time I watch it.  The good guys win.
 A classic story with great acting. Great adventure. A great lesson in faith, endurance, courage. Maybe a little intense for young kids.
 I just can't understand why everyone hates this movie! Of all the adventure films Iv'e seen (which is a lot, by the way), this is my all-time favorite. Yes I like it better than Return of the King, Mask of Zorro, Pirates of The Carribbean, anything. It is a fun and entertaining swashbuckler set in 1800's France. Here is the story
 Going into the film I expected a good time, watching an okay movie and hanging with some pals. What I got was a good time, hanging with pals and watching an excellent movie! The much-filmed story gets restyled with youthful actors and an interesting script, not to mention the intriguing story. The story I am speaking of is that of Edmond Dantes (played with innocence and then anger by Jim Caviezel) who seems to be riding the high life with a new job as captain and a beautiful fiancee until he is arrested for treason. What Edmond doesn't know (at first) is that he has been set up by his jealous friend Ferdinand (played with evil smarmyness by Guy Pearce). With such high caliber acting and beautiful settings, it's tough not to be completely drawn into this story. I highly recommend that if you're going to the theaters this weekend, that you check this one out.
 When I first saw this movie, I was surfing the limited channels on our television a week or so ahead of the time they would actually come on so that I could catch any that sounded promising. This was one of those. The description sounded good and a few of the actors' names sounded familiar, although I had never seen any of their movies to date.  So, last night when my sister and I had nothing to do, we decided to switch it on. And let me tell you. It was worth it. Though a little confusing at times, I found this movie highly enjoyable. It also made sense, which was good. There seemed to be a reason for everything.  And, okay I'll just say it. One of the main reasons this is such a good movie is because Jim Caviezel was the main character. Like I said, I had never seen any of his movies (and I still haven't exept for this one, of course) so, I was somewhat surprised to see how hot he was. I mean, yes, it did take some time for me to see the full extent of it, but when I did, I couldn't stop talking and thinking about it.  You would think that it was utterly impossible for a man to look hot in all the stages of his life, miserable as it was at times. I mean, he looked hot in every single scene. Especially as the Count.  Basically this is a movie about revenge. Edmund Dontes is in love with this girl named Mercedees, but can't marry her because he is too poor to buy a ring. He is charged with high treason for delivering a letter for someone, and is sent to prison at a horrible place where he stays for 13 years. Meanwhile Mercedees and his best friend, who actually helped frame him, get married. Edmund escapes and finds all this treasure and gets really rich. He then decides to get revenge on everyone who wronged him.  This is a pretty good movie. I wouldn't give it five stars though. Probably about 4.5 or something. But Jim Caviezel helps a bunch. He is a really good actor. I guess you won't know 'til you watch it.
 Americans spend more money than they make and that's the modern trend in today's society.  This stems from the fact that it is so convenient to live this way but it is also a progressive danger to consumers and the economy. The public faces a daily barrage of advertisements for credit cards and lending options and it filters down to everyone in all walks of life.  In 2005 alone, the top 10 credit card companies spent over 2 billion dollars in advertising.  Commercials have been shown to use subtle and creative messages to tap into your subconscious desire to spend money but no attempts are made to educate individuals about any fiscal responsibilities.  The situation is even worse when you realize that many companies have inflated interest rates, they overcharge on late fees, and some often misappropriate confidential consumer information such as you personal credit history.  Looking at the dilemma of this debt crisis begs the question of what is going wrong.  A big element is the fact that rising costs of healthcare, housing, education, and consumer goods hurts so many and credit and lending play a significant part here.  The federal government is another factor that does not favor the consumer and hurts you more than it helps.  Recent bankruptcy reform initiated by President Bush now makes it more difficult for persons to file bankruptcy and recover from financial hardship.  Powerful lobbyists in Washington are very influential in helping to manipulate fiscal policies and financial institutions are the number one contributors to political campaigns.  There really isn't any happy ending in sight to this widespread problem but there is a growing light at the end of the tunnel.  Consumer advocate groups are becoming more prominent nowadays and their attempts at debt education and awareness are steadily working their way into mainstream society.  Any type of help whatsoever is productive and necessary for everyone affected and this keeps the hope alive that we can eventually make significant progress in overcoming our huge dependency on borrowed money and credit.  `In Debt We Trust' really appealed to me because it was quite comprehensive in how much material it covered and because it was presented in an easy to understand and straightforward manner.  For informational and educational purposes, I would seriously recommend this documentary to everyone.
 Every senior in high school and freshmen in college should watch this film! It lays out the important issue of personal finance very clear. At some point, young adults will see how important maintaining good credit, mastering a budget and committing to saving will pay off--for good or for bad.
 Keep up the good work Danny! I hope you do another documentary on this ever expanding problem. Reward cards are something that need looking at more closely. Who is actually paying these "rewards". It's the merchant fees that we all pay for whether we use credit cards or not! Fact is, many people can't use a reward card or simply don't want to deal with greedy credit card co's and their long list of dirty tricks and yet they don't get a discount when they pay cash because everywhere you go, they take credit cards. And that means merchant fees that we all pay in the form of higher prices!  And these card co's have it set up so the merchants can't give a lower price for cash customers! It's outrageous! And I hope you do more about debt buyers. It's insane these co's can buy debt for pennies on the dollar and then pile on more interest.  Interest is supposed to be charged for money borrowed!  Nobody borrowed money from a debt buyer and yet they can charge interest! It doesn't make any sense to put someone in debt further. And last but not least, these predators who flood the mailboxes of the newly bankrupt should not be allowed to send them any mail for at least ten years. That is the amount of time bankruptcy remains on someones credit report. If the newly bankrupt want to get back in the credit card game, then let them find these cos. There should be a law that these co's with their dreadful offers not be allowed to send offers to those who have just gotten out of bankruptcy. Unfortunatly, some will not understand these offers or will be desperate. They are nothing but a trap wrapped in envelopes with seductive message like "we want to help you re establish your credit or "you deserve a second chance". Those who have filed bankruptcy have gotten a second chance and these predators only want a second chance at ripping them off and putting them in debtors prison again! These co's will even extend credit to people living below the poverty line!!
 While on vacation several years ago my wife and I got roped into a timeshare presentation.  At the end, I told the salesman, "We don't have the money for it.  He smiled, saying, "Finance!  Finance vacation?  A house and a car are the only purchases for which one should borrow money.  And I'm not even sure about borrowing for a car as I pay cash for mine, but then, I buy only used models.  The documentary IN DEBT WE TRUST shows just how legal loan-sharking has become in the United States.  Credit card companies and subprime mortgage lenders break Americans who have not already lost their shirts to unemployment and medical bills.  Perhaps no one forces people into the traps of A.P.R.s and A.R.M.s, but this film demonstrates how the creditors hoodwink their victims.  Holding a gun on them would be honest, at least.  IN DEBT WE TRUST includes testimonials from people who should have put off that vacation rather than take a loan for it or kept renting rather than buy a home.  That smiling timeshare salesman may as well have told me, "A place to go on vacation every year?  Priceless.  And what do America's leaders have to say as this consumption culture destroys people's finances? As George W. Bush and Rudy Giuliani said shortly after the 9/11 terror attack, "Go shopping.  Later, Bush would sign a bill limiting Americans' bankruptcy options.  See IN DEBT WE TRUST.
 This powerful program exposed the credit card industry and how with the political power of Congress trap the consumer into what the program produced called "21st century serfdom".  This program was made before the 2008 economic melt-down and it was so true that the country is still on the rocky road despite the government declared recession was over two years ago, as the unemployed max out the 99 weeks of benefits.  As recent as last week, the political leaders of both parties argued in Congress to raise the debt ceiling to borrow more while still accusing others of currency manipulation.  Spend, spend, and spend out of a recession?  Will our kids, grand-kids, great grand-kids inherit this debt which may endanger our status, credit and national security?
 This is clearly a great flick that lets the viewer 'see' how the banks view you the credit consumer.  It really goes into accurate detail on how the finance industry is trying to snare consumers from and young age and create a generation of debt slaves.  They also have a chilling prediction on where all this 'debt' is heading.  I highly recommend this flick.
 This should be shown in all high schools and all colleges. Parents should have to show this to their children (and some should watch themselves.
 I went on a debt reduction program on my own at 42 years old and now at 45 I am debt free. I recommend that you buy this DVD at any price. I also recommend that you don't watch it alone. Let some others benefit from the knowledge of what debt has and is doing to our society. Even if they don't do anything about it at least they will have the education of how the debt system works.
 This docu is as informative as it is depressing but needs to be watched by EVERYONE. You should buy this just for the "indie debt songs sprinkled throught. I love it! Now off to spend w/ my credit card 
 I have been obsessed with Van Gogh, since I first laid eyes on his originals in L.A.. Prints of his work just don't show the awe inspiring life force that emanates from his paintings.  Through the Eyes of Van Gogh is a sensitive and intense work of art in itself. It achieves an externalization of Van Gogh's internal struggles of trying to make a living, trying to relate to others, trying to hold on to his unique vision of art and his brave battle with mental illness, all of which he felt he failed at, at the time of his suicide. I feel this film brilliantly achieves looking through the eyes of Van Gogh, by focusing on his time in the mental hospital with the addition of flashbacks to pivotal points in his life. The writer, who is also the actor who portrays Vincent, has created a portrait of Van Gogh that is as palpable as his paintings.
 Who is Alexander Barnett?  He is the man who wrote, directed and stars in what is arguably the most poignant and profound portrayal of Vincent van Gogh ever put on film. There have been many movie Van Goghs
 A remarkably sincere, honest, HUMAN insight into the pain Van Gogh endured. There's something humble and heartfelt about Alexander Barnett's performance that seems to me to be the most realistic portrayal of Van Gogh I have yet seen.

 When rich man Cyrus J. Rutherford dies all the heirs show up for the reading of a bizarre will. While Cyrus's unique tomb is constructed, the heirs stay in the house. The will insults the heirs, then claims that some will get vasts amounts while others get cab fare. If Cyrus's body is not interned by his wishes then the heirs will swap places, i.e. those that get the most will now get the least. No one knows who is going to get what, they can only guess...or does someone know? Bela plays the butler who tries to give everyone "poisoned coffee late in the evening, which they all refuse. Jack Haley (The Tin Man) plays an insurance agent who shows up to sell the dead Cyrus a policy, not knowing he is deceased. The guests mistake him for the detective they hired to guard the body.  Of course Bela is not the only seemingly trying to knock off heirs...Then there are those who suspect they are the least of the heirs. They want to steal and hide the body so they can get a greater share. Sweet Carol Dunlap (Jean Parker) is suspected of getting the largest share. Lyle Talbot, who starred in so many Ed Wood films is in this one as well as Dorothy Granger from "Death Valley Days.  The sound track at times indicates this is a "horror film while at other times a comedy. It is far from a horror movie. At one point when someone is killed, the suspects are all gathered into one room, as a real who-dun-it murder mystery, except with the comedy of Jack Haley leading the spoof.  This is an excellent film which has stood the test of time. The jokes are a bit punny. It is not a blockbuster, but one that certainly can be enjoyed and appreciate by a younger generation. My only negative on this film is that the copy I saw could have used some restoration, especially the sound track.
 This was a great film. Jack Halley is comical as usual and Bela Lugos is hilarious even in his tiny role. I love this flick.
 I used to watch The Time Machine in black and white TV when I was little child.  I did not understand what they said because of my deafness.  Now I just loved it in color and even closed-captioned in an excellent condition.  I just prefer to get the closed-captioned video tapes so we could enjoy to watch them.
 My dear, dear friend,  time-lapse photography,  introduced itself to me in  The Time Machine,  and I was forever changed. It showed me worlds I had not seen, at least, not in a fantastical sense. As a boy in the Seventies, I was not able to see this film in the theater, but the impact it made on me was equal to a nuclear explosion. The giddy feeling of following the intrepid time traveller through the ages was like climbing Everest for the first time, or stepping foot on the Moon. That may be hyperbole, but the thrill of seeing a lit candle melt quickly down to the candlestick in seconds was palpable. Electric. Captivating. I absorbed every image, every sound, and I was there with Rod Taylor every step of the way. It was an exhilerating ride, and it's one I highly recommend that you take. I hope that the ride is as thrilling for you as it was for me.
 By today's standards this movie might be weak.  The special effects are  primitive and it is not pushing H. G. Well's point.  Nonetheless, I have  watched this movie everytime it has appeared on t.v.  It has a certain  charm and innocence, not to mention that Rod Taylor derserved more work as  a leading man.  Maybe it is my  guilty pleasure,  but this movie  never grows tiresome. I recommend this movie to any sic-fi fan (and to  everyone else!).
 This film ranks as quite literaly my all time favorite.  It has everything in it
 It was a great book and although this movie is a bit different from the original book, the movie gives us a great look at the view of the future in the 1960's.  Obviously H. G. Well could not imagine a nuclear holocaust to destroy what we know of civilization, but it is a better explanation then what the book gives us and is easier to relate to.  H. G. Wells was trying to show us the downfall of civilization through industrialization, and the movie shows us the modern problem of the 1960's.
 The original short novel by H.G. Wells, "The Time Machine", was not written with movie theatres in mind. Wells' masterpiece is a grim and thoughtful social satire - a genre which works well as a piece of literature, but would really stink as a 2-hour feature film... Only a genius could use this raw material to create a decent sci-fi film
 I watched the remake of the Time Machine and expected it to be awesome.  It wasn't awesome, but it was ok.  The special effects were really cool and all, but the story itself seemed to move too fast.  I then went and rented the original Time Machine.  I liked the original far more than the remake.  The scientist narrarates the whole movie and the story is so much better.  I will admit--the special effects were cheesy, but what can you expect??This movie was made in 1960!!  If you want to see a great movie that has mystery, horror, action, and suspense, this is the one to buy.  I reccommend this highly to everyone!!
 I've become a bit of a skeptic, and even more of a cynic over the years whenever I hear of a major production company doing a remake of an original movie. I've come to realize that 'remakes' rarely live up to the original, except perhaps in special effects (which they often surpass). But special effects does not a classic make, unless that's all you look for in a movie. I have no doubt that the 2002 release of 'The Time Machine' will trounce the original in this department, but everything else being equal, I doubt it will become a classic, as this movie has. Having said that I must say the original 'Time Machine' is perhaps one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies of all time. What makes this movie special is the great attention to plot and characterization, as well as keeping scrupulously to the H.G. Wells novel, both in content and in characterization. By contrast I've heard that the remake was quite revisionary.  Rod Taylor does a splendid job in portraying the inventor with a consciense, the man who must wrestle with questions that have no easy answers. The viewer can sympathize with his predicament of using his invention for the betterment - or detriment - of mankind, no easy task since he is surrounded by friends who can only think in terms of the material.  At the core of this movie is his friendship with David, played splendidly by Alan Young (Mr. Ed). One of the most noticeable things about this film is the commaraderie between these two men, as well as their differences
 Simply one of the most entertaining films of all time.  Great special effects...remember when people built stuff out of real things and had to suspend your disbelief without crappy ass flimsy transparent souless computer graphics?  I'm telling you man, the entrance to the Morlock Caves exists...a truly resourceful ingenius use of special effects for its time!  As a young lad I watched this movie countless times.  Dad's, get this movie for your adolescent son.  He will love it.  I've never seen the remake...I'm sure it sucks for air.  The music is fantastic and is half the experience.  George Pal predicted the moptop haircut with the Eloi actors only a couple years before the British Invasion.  The extras are actually worth watching with an added scene made quite a few years later...highly amusing.  And it's got Mr. Ed's owner in it and he's a superb actor...now c'mon!  Get the credit card out!  And then there's the part when he spins the talking coins and they tell of the recent past.  And  there's the part with the nuclear bomb and the lava and then he sets fire to a Morlock and he explodes and then and then and then....it's awesome.
 What a difference watching this dvd compared to watching it on vhs. The picture is so clear!  Lots of extras at the end. This is a great movie, watch it several times a year and never get tried of it.
 Geroge Pal, with his groundbreaking visual-effects and his eye for detail add a sharpness to this classic telling of H.G. Wells famous story.  Rod Taylor's performance is over-the-top at times (as is he were channeling Charleton Heston at times) but otherwise straight-forward and charming.  The Morlocks vs. The Eloi...Hmmmm.  Interesting stuff.  After taking his time going into the future, first stop in the 40's, second the 60's  and then .... on to 802701.  Civilization is in ancient ruins .... technology seems to have expired.  Here are the Eloi, a group of futuristic nymphs and idiots dressed in skimpy pastel togas singing and staring and giggling like cretins.  Life is simple...as George the Time Traveler learns when one of the pretty little nymphettes starts to drown in the river and no one rushes to her aid.  Enter hero George... he soon discovers that there's something sinister in this braindead paradise...enter the Morlocks.  The Morlocks are a group of critters that used to be human thousands and thousands of years ago but were transformed when they fled the surface of the planet (probably because of the implied nuclear halocaust) to dwell in the darkness.  Glowing eyes, blue-green skin, blond fur running down the top of both arms...these creeps mean business.  A siren starts to wail and the Eloi start marching like mesmerized lemmings to a cliff...into the underground.  For...here's the kicker...the Eloi are the Morlock's food supply.  Can you say cannibalism?  I knew you could.  Overall, this 1960 classic can't be denied its rightful place in film history.  Looking back the effects pale in the light of CGI, but they were more pure back then, more real, and people like George Pal paved the way for the things possible today.  This is a great movie!  Be not afraid...far, far superior to the remake.  Dig it!
 When I first saw this movie I was only 8. I saw it on TV and -due to the TV set-in B & W not it color. However it had a great impact on me because of the incredible and magical special effects. For a small boy years away from the computers enviroment this was the very best movie of all...and it still is.  I wonder why George Pal never become such a great entrepreneur as Walt Disney. Obviously the both had a special gift and used it to bring their imagination close to the public mainly through motion pictures.  And in speaking of pictures, Pal and Disney established their own landmarks, from my point of view, with "The Time Machine and "20,000 Leagues under the Sea respectively.  "The Time Machine may seem outdated compare to the astonishing CGI movies of nowadays but it has something that will keep it on the SCI FI top ranking
 Every viewing of The Time Machine takes me back to the wonders of childhood
 I cannot say how faithful this movie is to the book, however it is an outstanding science fiction movie.  The cinematic techniques available for this movie are not as garish as you might see today, but are nonetheless very effective in supporting the cracking screenplay.  Rod Taylor's potrayal of Wells is spot on and deserving of special note.  The sets are also exceptional with the period furniture and architecture very well done.  It is a classic story well adapted to the screen.  I recommend this movie to all true science fiction and Time travel fans.
 The Time Machine is one of the best science fiction films made and it has always been one of my favorites! The first time I watched this was when I was in the first grade. The movie is about an inventor named George[Rod Taylor] who has greated a time machine and goes on a journey into the year 802701.   The movie starts out when you see David Filby[one of George's friends] walking up to George's house where you see some more of his friends. Then eventually you see George but he's been beaten up because he has gone on a long journey. Then he talks about the story.   In the next part, George is showing his friends the tiny model of his time machine and he want's to proove that time travel really exists. But, when his friends don't believe him he decides to go on the long journey.   Then you see George going through many different time periods into he finally gets to the year 802701. Instead of having a lot of technology it's just an area of grass. There are a group of people there named the Eloi and they obey a group of monsters called morlocks. The morlocks give the Eloi their food, clothing and in the end they take them underground and kill them. So then George meets one of the girls named Weena when she is just about to drown but luckily George saves her. But, soon George gets mad when he finds out that the Eloi don't work very much and they mostly just play, so he goes back to his machine. But, thats when the trouble begins. The morlocks have stolen his machine! They grabbed it and put it in their secret place. So, the only thing left to do is go to the underground area, kill the morlocks, save the eloi and get his machine back and that mostly takes you to the end where George gets his machine back and luckily travels back to his own time.   When George finishes telling them the story they think it is silly but when George shows David the flower that Weena gave to him he starts to change his opinion.   In the end George takes a few books with him and travels back to 802701 to see the eloi again.   The special features include
 If I only had a machine like that...... This movie get your attention and your curiosity. What would you do in the actor's shoes?. I only wish I had a machine like that....... Overall
 I used to watch this movie on ABC afternoon theater after school in the `70s. I always felt it was the best time travel movie. Having seen more recent and modern time travel movies I must admit that this one is still the best. The extras on the DVD are insightful and interesting and the movie itself has never looked better. Any Sci-Fi fan or HG Wells fan will love this movie.
 This movie is very entertaining. An inventor has constructed a time machine in the end of the 19th century. His friends don't believe it's true, even when he shows them a small size model. The last day of the century, he tests the time machine. He makes a first stop in 1917 (It's quite illogic here, that nobody has during all the years, walked up to his laboratory to look for him and found the time machine). He continues his journey through time and experiences the ruin of the civilization from a nuclear bomb. He ends up in about 80,000 years into the future. He finds a new civilization which, at first sight, seems to be a paradise. But he realizes something is wrong. He has to help the people, who are everything but driven to change their situation. The Time Machine is a very good movie. It's a great story, good actors, scenery, and Academy Award winning special effects. The time machine looks really cool.
 I'm presently doing a "life's review in that I'm accumulating old stories for my library that were popular in my days of yore. This version of THE TIME MACHINE fell into that category.
 If you're watching this, then you know what you're getting into. This is one of the top sci-fi/fantasy movies of the era alongside "War of the Worlds, and "The Day The Earth Stood Still.  A terrific yarn, very well acted and (for the time) great special effects. The transfer to DVD brings out the colors and clarity of the movie.  If you're a fan of 50's-60's science fiction/fantasy, then this needs to be in your collection.
 We watched this on Prime, being familiar with the story from a children's book that our kids have.  Given the age of the movie (1960) I didn't know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality - the acting, the sets, and the story itself.  Obviously there are a few parts that are comically terrible given what we're accustomed to in sci-fi and CGI today.  But they don't really detract from the overall experience, and the parts that are done well are simply excellent.  Recommended.
 George Pal's 1960 Masterpiece of Sci~Fi/Fantasy is a delight to the eyes and ears. Spectacular colors, costumes,sets and music combine to make the Best Movie in my opinion of this genre of the early 60's. You have time travel,history lessons,girl in distress,and evil monsters.Perfect. Alongside "Forbidden Planet and "Robinson Crusoe On Mars",this is in my Top 3 Favorite Sci~Fi Films ever!
 I heard some bad reviews on the quality of transfer but I thought It was just fine the colors werent as vibrant as the VHS I was replaceing but some people may like the colors more toned down. personally I thought It was well worth the price I paid & liked it better than the remake.
 Others have said it better so I'll keep my review brief. The restoration work on this film is excellent
 If you are H. George Wells, you long to live in a time without war.  Perhaps that is what drives your obsession with time, the devices that measure it, and the desire, above all, to invent a machine that will allow you to zip through the centuries to a more peaceful and saner era. . . .  Tucked away in your solarium, you have crafted such a device.  At first glance, one might think it was a one-man sleigh, with bent brass bars, a red-velvet chair, and a large odd-looking concave copper disk just aft of the traveller's seat.  When the disc spins, the encoding on its rim ( 1 4 2 3 1 4 5 1 etc. ) activates the machine like the prongs on a music box; the faster it spins, the faster it moves through time.  You take a seat.  The controls are simple.  Firstly, you activate the display circuits; the switches are on top of the control cylinder in front of you
 I recently bought this movie on Amazon and just finished watching it.  This movie was better than many new movies that cost two or three times as much.  Though this movie was created a long time ago, nothing in it seems to be dated in a manner that lessens my enjoyment.  The plot was very good in my opinion.  It is based a written story by HG Wells who is known as the "Father of Science Fiction".  For people who are not big science fiction lovers, this movie should still be a good movie, because it doesn't go overboard with discussion and narration about technical details like many science fiction books/movies.  Wells was very skilled in writing in many other genres, so the movie is focused more on George and the people around him than objects/props and technology itself.  I will eventually watch this movie again.
 Arrived as stated and in good shape... no issues or problems included a special feature George and David Filby reunite ( both actors have aged filmed well after file was )
 This movie is the best every of the time travel movies that has been made. It has good actors,very good special effects,with good background scenery. I highly recommend it.
 As a sci-fi person, can't find movies like this anywhere except online. I've watched this movie "Time Machine when I was little in the 60's, It was the greatest. Hey! in those days they did what they can as a youngster to scare the witts out of you, but today's movie technology is even scarier. For me I like the old sc-fi, simlpe and fun to watch all over again. See you in the future.
 I purchased this as a surprise gift for my husband who loves older Sci-Fi movies and he loves it!  He knew of the movie but had forgotten about it.  This was not a title he had on his 'wish list' but when I was buying another movie for him I noticed that others had purchased this one as well.  (Great strategy Amazon!  Putting those suggestions on the page works!) I took a chance on this purchase & I want to say "Thanks to the other Sci-Fi fans out there who helped me surprise him.  Ok...so I can't really write a review of the movie because I fell asleep watching it.  Sorry fans!  I'm sure if you enjoy this era of movies, you will enjoy this movie as well.
 This has to be the best time travel movie I ever seen.  None other comes close.  I like the scene where there is a flat screen tv in the background when the time traveler comes to 1966 and a little girl drops her Woody Woodpecker doll.  Great plot and an all out great movie!
 "The Time Machine is an all-time favorite of ours.  Ranks up top with "Forbidden Planet and "The Thing (original)  Please note that on Instant Video the co-star Yvette Mimieux is not credited correctly...they have another Yvette listed.
 THE TIME MACHINE is a heartwarming sci-fi adventure film which I can watch for the umpteenth time on a Monday, then get ready to sit down on Tuesday and eagerly watch it all over again.  Preposterous as time travel may seem to the three-dimensional mind, the idea has doubtless captivated the imagination of everyone at least once during his life. My own wondrous "journey into the future via this spellbinding film began when I was a teenager back in the early 60s, and I have returned countless times to the gentle Eloi and cannibalistic Morlocks with that same renewed sense of dazzled expectation I experienced on previous occasions.  This is a film that truly delivers.  The special effects are outstanding...the acting superb...the drama riveting!  Rod Taylor, as the inventor of the time machine, is relentlessly -- believably! -- heroic in the role of H. G. Wells; Yvette Mimieux -- with one of the most crushingly beautiful faces ever to appear on earth -- is unforgettable as the innocent Weena; Alan Young's sensitive portrayal of David Filby (the only one of Wells' friends wise and compassionate enough to lend support to Wells' "outlandish theories) makes a lasting impression on the viewer.  And one of the major, not-to-be-overlooked highlights of this endearing film is the evocative musical score provided by Russell Garcia, which I'm listening to now as I write this review. The sweeping main theme pulls you right into the drama, while the "London theme tugs gently at the heartstrings. (There's one gorgeous passage here that's straight out of Debussy.  Has anyone made note of it?)  Don't miss THE TIME MACHINE for the world, and give yourself the chance to see what great filmmaking was capable of creating 50 long years ago.
 EXCELLENT !  A MUST HAVE ...  THE NEW REMAKES SRE NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINALS.  TIME MACHINE IS TRULY AN ORIGINAL AND DONE QUITE WELL.
 Really a great buy at this price. Don't be fooled into thinking this is another 'B' Sci-Fi movie. This is really well done, with fine special effects, and good acting. No, it's not Jimmy Stewart and Betty Davis quality, but what is?  This is the iconic 'Time Machine' movie. The one all the others hope to be.
 I have been looking for this original H. G. Wells classic with Rod Taylor and Alan Young for quite a while. Watched it as soon as it arrived and I wasn't disappointed!! It's a great film, I would recommend it to everyone.
 I remember seeing and being fascinated by this movie as a youngster and while the special effects are obviously dated, it's still a favorite. Make sure you check out the Special Features and see the segment hosted by a much older and stouter Rod Taylor, telling how the Time Machine itself was made, how it survived the years in spite of finally being found in a thrift shop (!), was restored and was used in the 'Back to the Future' movies, among other video clips. His touching tribute to George Pal, the movie's producer, is very moving.  No, this doesn't follow the original storyline entirely but it's a wonderful adventure nonetheless.
 In addition to an all-time excellent movie, this edition supplies interviews with the cast and those who worked on the film with them. A very touching scene is played out between Rod Taylor and Alan Ladd, reprising their roles in the movie. This is too good of a deal to pass up. Glad I bought mine!
 The movie is one of the all time Sci-Fi classics. By today's special effects standards, it doesn't hold a candle, but that really doesn't make any difference because the story is timeless and for the time it was made, the effects are pretty impressive. I remember seeing The Time Machine in the theater as a kid and I've watched it many times since then. When I saw that I could own a NEW DVD of the movie I jumped at the chance. Especially interesting and entertaining is the "new scene they've put into the special features.
 Remake of the original classic is a classic in itself.  Great fantasy movie... great acting by all.  A must own movie!
 One's imaginagion can not help but be stirred after viewing this timeless masterpiece.  If you're looking for a pleasant hour-plus of sci-fi type entertainment then this one is for you.  Enjoy!
 This particular adaptation of H.G. Well's novel, though not entirely following the text's plot, seen more times than memory serves, will never lose its appeal, its mystic qualities nor its political ramifications.  In the novel, the protaganist, a scientist of great passion, grows posessed to go back in time and prevent the death of his true love. He attempts to prevent her death many times, but she dies anyway despite his efforts under different circumstances - "one cannot prevent fate"?  Rod Taylor does a supurb job as the curious scientist, moving into future time, as we see 1960 special effects of fashion changes, and the creation of the horseless carriage. He moves forward with great pace as the earth is destroyed by man. Thousands of years pass, as the rocks of centuies finally disapate to find himself in a kind of paradise, where berry's are the size of soccer balls.  Later we find the earth is divided into two types
 A great movie.  My family has watched it several times, and never get tired of it.
 The Time Machine is one hour and forty-three minutes long and was released on August 17, 1960. The movie tells the story of an inventor named Herbert George Wells (George to his friends) who invents a time machine. George is unhappy in his own time and wants to travels to the future. The film starts in the present and George four friends are at his house waiting for him to arrive. George has left instructions to start dinner without him if he is not there at 8 pm. Just at the four guests are about to dine, George enters the room dirty and clothes torn. George begins the story five days ago when he shows them a prototype of a miniature time machine. When the four friends leave the house, George heads toward his lab and climb into the large scale model and heads into the feature. At first he starts off slowly the he begins to go faster and faster until he reaches October 12, 802,701. George lands in an almost paradise world. The only downside is that there are two different classes of people. The first class live on the land and are called the Eloi and they live simple life of no laws, government and civilization. They know nothing of their past and seems to be void of thought as well. The Elois speak in a childlike way. The second group of people is the Morlocks who live underground, operates the machinery, blue-skinned, and cannot stand the light. The Elois are basically cattle for the Morlocks. The Morlocks clothe, feed, and raise the Elois just to eat them when they are adults. George is appalled by all of this and tries to put this to an end. When George goes down a shaft to rescue Weena and the rest of the Elois and is able to blow up the shafts that the Morlocks can escape from. George eventually arrives five days later when he originally left from. His four friends do not believe his story, but David Filby seems to believe some of it. The Time Machine won an Academy Award for Best Effects, Special Effects (1961). The Time Machine is a great science fiction movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.  VHS FEATURES 1) Theatrical Trailer 2) Time Machine
 When I was a kid, the Morlocks scared the hell out of me. I still love this film though, lets face it, it would be easy to make a monkeys arse of such a great story but the directors hand is firm, and the little touches that make this film so good are so enjoyable. The tailors dummy with the changing clothes, the spinning discs that provide the back story for the Eloi, its wonderful. My own childhood niggles such as the lack of interest of his colleagues and the lack of surprise of the Scots ginger-haired chap who meets him twice "in the future annoyed me a little, but these are tiny glitches. Make no mistake, The Time Machine is a classic film and I hope one day my son will enjoy it as much as I did. Have to watch them Morlocks though!
 The movie is a timeless classic, just as I remembered from the first time I watched it a long, long time ago.
 Just re-watched this movie this weekend and forgot how good it was. Alan Young plays Taylor's best friend and there are great behind-the-scenes stories for this movie in Young's book MISTER ED AND ME (I believe that is the title) also available on Amazon.com. If you love Morlocks, beautiful women, Oscar winning special effects and clever plots, this movie is for you.
 I first viewed this film when I was 11 years old and I must confess that seeing this movie impacted my whole life.  I still have drawings I did in grade school of glass-domed futuristic houses with large double entrance doors.  The time machine itself, is so humorous, but it is what they would have had in the 1800s for such a contraption.  I was entranced by the Eloi and their lack of emotion and having to do nothing but eat fruit all day.  My infantile mind thought that would be a GOOD life.  I consider this a much better movie than its "twin Journey to the Center of the Earth, but they were both great and thought-provoking, especially to pre-teenagers. The scenes and special effects are phenomenal.  It is because of this movie that I probably eventually decided to write a time-travel novel of my own.  Rod Taylor was not my favorite actor, but he did a very good job in this movie.
 The Time Machine is not only a wonderful movie but it is a favorite subject of mine; the ability to move back or forth through millions of years fascinates me, especially the future as it is largely unknown. For its age the film is scarcely dated with fine acting and production values, and one of those that you can watch over and over. The question of what to bring with you into another civilization for better or worse is infinitely intriguing.
 I was very pleased with thr DVD "The Time Machine", mailed to me recently. It was in excellent condition and met my expectations. Thank you.
 Its the greatest, like you saw it the first time. It hasn't changed, maybe it has change a bit. LOOK OUT PAST, HERE COMES THE BEST!!
 The movie is still as great as when it first came out years ago. The service was quick.
 THE TIME MACHINE tells the story of (Rod Taylor), an enterprising Victorian scientist who develops a way-back machine that crushes four dimensions into three, so that human beings can be transported through time as well as through space.  The excitement of Victorian discovery is well conveyed, and Rod Taylor, the Australian he-man star, does an excellent job of seeming as though he can think as well as heave his muscles around.  His first moments inside the machine are thrilling, as light changes into dark with a rapidity that astounds him, then light again, then dark, then whole months pass within instants, and then whole years.  When he gets to the future he finds that human beings have somehow bifurcated into two distinct races, the Morlocks a race of strong men who are stupid, the other brainiac weaklings.  Obviously there was a Cold War undercurrent in this George Pal production, and even when we were kids we read the thuggish Morlocks as Stalinist supermen, while the Eloi were us, castrated professors educated out of our balls.  Rod Taylor's mission is to re-insert some backbone into those pale pacifist Eloi and get them to fight back against the creatures of the night.  Yvette Mimieux is Weena, exquisitely elfin and needy, in her leaf-colored linen dress, falling for George (HG Wells, Rod Taylor's character) despite her natural antipathy towards dark men.  This is one of the scariest movies ever made and yet, oddly enough, it is perfect for young children.  Maybe we all like to be frightened from time to time.  Funnily enough I hardly noticed the satirical messages in this movie when I was a little boy, all I knew was that I was scared of the Morlocks, pitied the Eloi, and identified with Rod Taylor and I wanted to be the one who would come sort out the mess of the whole world.  Towards the end of the film George is faced with a big dilemma-should he go back to the Victorian world or should he return to the world 1,000,000 years from now where Weena waits for him?  It's a treat on DVD, as are the special features and commentary, but Alan Young doesn't seem to have a bit of shame in him; he should have apologized to the entire world for the dreadful Scottish accent he uses in the movie.
 I saw this movie when I was a kid and it stood with me ever since. I just love the film, the machine and the overall plot. It just keeps you glued to the screen wanting to know more as the movie unfold. The simple but yet clear scientifical explanation early on in the film is a great suspense setter. Overall
 This review refers to the Warner Bros. DVD edition of  The Time Machine (1960)...... I am so impressed with how this 43 year old classic Sci-Fi film looks and sounds on the DVD, that I am going to start with that this time. I wasn't expecting it to look as great as it did because the editorial review here gives it 3 out of 5 stars on both the picture and the sound. If you are a big fan of this film, or thinking of buying it as a gift for someone who is, you will not be disappointed with this transfer. The picture is presented in the original widescreen format,so you won't miss a bit of the action. To watch it you would think you went back in the time machine to 1960 and were viewing it for the first time. It is clear and sharp with vibrant color.The soundtrack is remastered in Dolby Dig 5.1 and is a welcome enhancement.The DVD also includes a terrific Behind The Scenes documentary called  Time Machine...The Journey Back . The film's star Rod Taylor hosts and fans will love this informative feature. You'll get a good look at how the actual machine was made and the journey that it has taken in the last 40 years as well as other interesting tid bits. This feature has it's own scene selections to choose from or you can just watch it straight through. The film may be viewed in French and has subtitles in English and French.(my only teeny complaint would be that the black bar area is not used for these subtitles, they are at the bottom of the film). The story based on the novel by H.G. Wells is as captivating today as it ever was. You know the tale..... George(Rod Taylor)has all the time in the world. He tells his friends an incredible story of his adventures traveling through the ages in a time machine that he has built. As his story begins, he starts out slowly traveling through the 20th century. He doesn't like what he sees. War and destruction seem to be the fate of civilaztion.He pushes foward, quickly, and the years fly by. Finally stopping in the year 802701,he comes across what seems to be a paradise on earth. Clean air,fruit growing in abundance, and a society of young beautiful people, the Eloi, who don't seem to have a care in the world. But even in this Utopian like civilazation there's trouble amiss.The Morlocks are running things from underground and they are just as scary today as they ever were.So it's up to our guy George to save this future civilazation from the evil Morlocks,and try to get back home to the year 1900 for an 8pm dinner appointment..whew,what a great story! Directed brillantly by George Pal( 7 Faces of Dr. Lao / Atlantis the Lost Continent ), the film also boasts the great talents of Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot, and the lovely Yvette Mimieux, as  Weena , who adds a little romantic interest to the story. The film was awarded a well deserved Oscar for it's special effects(also discussed in the featurette) for Gene Warren and Tim Barr.The movie is rated G, although the scenes with the Morlocks might be a little scary for very young children. A great story, fabulous film and an outstanding DVD. So go back in time, with your old friend  The Time Machine ..enjoy...Laurie
 Like most people, I had only seen this classic science fiction movie on television.  That never detracted from the story, which is one of the best that Wells wrote, but it didn't prepare me for how great this movie looks and sounds.  The DVD provides brilliant color and a generally sharp picture with only a little, infrequent  softness that I suspect is from the original film.  I was surprised at how clean the transfer is.  I did not see any scratches, dust or other defects.  The movie is presented in its original, widescreen aspect ratio.  The sound is also excellent.  It has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and it is an excellent job for a movie that is forty years old.  As you would expect from such an old sound track, most of the action is in the center and front channels, but it uses the rear channels (especially noticable in key scenes, as when Rod Taylor is making echoes in the ruined dome building) and the subwoofer kicked in a few times, also.  The disc provides more extras than you would expect from a Warner release of an old movie.  It includes a trailer, filmographies for the three lead actors and George Pal, and a very good behind-the-scenes documentary.  The documentary was produced by Bob Burns 32 years after the making of the movie and focuses on the important part the time machine prop played in the making of the movie and it's history since, with an interesting account of how Burns found and then restored the original prop.  The documentary also features a scene in which Rod Taylor and Alan Young recreate their characters from the movie, acting out a scene that might have appeared in the movie but did not.  The scene uses the restored time machine prop to good effect and it was rather touching to see these much older actors slip so comfortably into their roles.  You could tell that this movie had been one of the high points of their careers and they remembered it fondly.  Likewise, Whit Bissel recreates his character in a short monologue full of a sense of nostalgia.  This old documentary was much more informative and interesting than a lot of the publicity puff pieces included on more recent films as extras. I highly recommend this DVD.  It delivers far more than I ever expected and does this classic movie justice.
 Based on the famous novel of H. G. Wells, a young inventor constructs a device that  enables him to travel to the future, to see what the future will depart us. But this somber gaze has nothing to do with a promissory future where harmony and peace will reign.  Regardless the spanning years, the film still strike you. Memorable special effects and imaginative stages, where the vigorous profile of Rod Taylor is admirably compensated with that sidereal beauty who Yvette Mimieux was.  Georges Pal would eventually the same director of the famous cult movie
 I've had the Time Machine on VHS forever it seems. Taped it off the TV years ago. But when I saw this DVD, it blew me away! I had NO IDEA! Never have I seen every colour in his jacket, every grain of dirt, every hair on his head with such clarity. The time machine absolutely shines with beauty too. I sat with my jaw hanging open and goose bumps on my arms even as soon as the opening credits when I heard the surround sound kick in. My VHS copy always had a really bad audio track, but on the DVD, you can actually hear the faint electrical buzz of the machine running in the lab before he hits that crystal lever. I saw and heard things I never knew existed in this movie.  And it has a fabulous documentary with it, hosted by Rod Taylor, that explains everything we always wondered like what happened to that little model of the machine that he put the cigar in, and the full scale machine itself has a story that you won't believe! All in all, it's a wonderful movie, and everything a DVD should be. Brilliant, vibrant, with gut vibrating audio. (and still better than the remake that was just in theatres) Fantastic!
 Great movie about a man who travels through time into the future, and then finds his lover who is absolutley beautiful in the year 800,000. Buy this one, it's a classic
 WHERE IS THE BLU-RAY ALREADY?!? HOW LONG MUST WE WAIT?!? WOULD BE AN INSTANT BUY FOR SOOO MANY?!? C'MON HOLLYWOOD!!!
 Though the film has flaws, mostly on the corney side, I think it is safe to say that this is the best adaptation of one of H.G. Wells' novels to film yet produced.  Wells imaginatively projected the "class struggle pondered by Marx (of the capitalist owners vs. workers without a share in the means of production) 800,000 years into the future.  In this way, combining with Darwinian evolution, it becomes a struggle between two sub-species
 I've loved this movie forever and now that's it restored, I love it more. I bought the two together to show my kids.  Wonderful film.
 I have watched this many times over the years since I was a kid and it never fails to enthral.
 This is a good fantasy movie. Rod Taylor is terrific in his role as is Yvette Mimeux. If you want action and adventure, this is the movie for you.
 THIS IS ONE OF H.G. WELLS CLASSICS. I SAW IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. IT'S JUST AS GOOD NOW AS IT WAS THEN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.
 Several 3rd grade classes in my school viewed this movie (rated G)after reading a version of the book.  We'd read it chapter by chapter and reviewed with EOG-style questions.  Wow-talk about a page-turner!  The children could not wait to read the next chapter just as soon as we finished the last.  Watching the movie was a fun way to see the images we'd created in our minds come to life.  This was the original version (I think the best) and because it is rated G, I felt very comfortable showing it to my students.
 The chronological setting of the movie is New Year's Eve 1899.  George Wells (named in honor or the author of the original book) is just hours from seeing another century.  But he is not satisfied with that, nor does he have to be.  He wants to go many centuries into the future.  The H.G. Wells book this movie is based on was written in 1895 close to when this movie is set.  It was also the first story of time travel by mechanical means.  "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain six years beforehand was about time travel via a bump on the head.  In fact it was this book that coined the phrase "time machine.  The movie closely follows the book except that it takes advantage of knowledge of 20th Century history not available to writers in the 1890's.  When traveling into the future George stops during the two World Wars and the year 1966 which was a future year when this movie was made.  Then he narrowly escapes a nuclear blast.  This encases him and his machine in rock forcing him to continue traveling into the future until the rock was worn away over time.  He stops in the year 802,701.  George expects to see new inventions and progress.  He is shown some advanced technology but not much.  What he first sees is a lush garden and people, all blond and young, living in leisure.  It appears that mankind has found a way back to the Garden of Eden.  But something is just not right.  For starters they do nothing when one of them is drowning in the river.  The time traveler rescues the woman whose name is Weena and asks about her people's "rather curious attitude.   He finds out more about these people.  They are called the Eloi.  There are people underground called the Morlock.  But they do not look anything like the Eloi.  These Morlocks are blue skinned, big eyed, monstrous looking people.  Over time the human race has divided into two species.  The Eloi have everything provided to them by the Morlocks but they pay a price for it.  They all must eventually go underground to be eaten by the Morlocks.  They respond to a siren with the exact same sound that civil defense sirens have been sounding since the beginning of the 20th Century.  The time traveler had heard this sound during his stop in a World War II air raid and in the 1966 nuclear holocaust as people were being warned to seek shelter.  Apparently people had been so conditioned to respond to that sound by going underground that the Eloi were doing so mindlessly.  H.G. Wells was concerned about the working class increasingly working underground.  In this story, this perceived trend of his has progressed to an extreme.  There is a lot more to this story than someone going into the future and seeing new gadgets.  On top of being a fun movie, it is rich in social commentary.  The movie gives one the experience of traveling with the main character.
 The Time Machine is a "deep thought movie. This has always been a favorite of mine. I have watched it many times.
 The time machine was an excellent movie.  I highly recommend it.  Rod Taylor is a superb actor, and makes this movie a classic.
 This is the story of George "H.G. Wells (Rod Taylor) who is an inventor. He has invited his friends to a dinner and is inexcusably late. Staggering in all disheveled he is asked what happened to him. So he relays the story.  A week earlier it was the turn of the century. He was showing his latest invention "The Time Machine. With this machine he could go into the future or the past. Being an optimist about mans future he chose the future. The adventure begins. --------------------------------------------------------  This is the definitive time machine movie. There have been others before and others after "Time After Time (1979). There has been time without machines "Somewhere in Time"(1980). But just as Cecil's "The Ten Commandments (1956) is the version you remember.  There are other remakes or versions of this story made later. The (1978) TV version which did a fair job of portraying the book even if it looked like a TV movie; Priscilla Barnes played Weena.  An earlier make of the movie (1949) Mary Donn played Weena. Then they forgot how to make movies and went to today's sound bit razzle-dazzle shallow version (2002) hopefully not the last attempt, looks like Weena is out too.  Rod Taylor's time machine is the one that you remember. An interesting side note is that in the book "The Time Machine by H. G. Wells, Weena was not much worth messing around with and defiantly did not look like Yvette Mimieux.  Later in the story mankind breaks into two species. The interesting part is that in the book the reason was social. In this movie it is war and the A-bomb. In future movies it is eugenics. Given today's climate it will probably be social again.  Any way I want the fancy time machine and a Morlock suit.  <a href="http
 This film was made before CG, before Star Wars and Star Trek and all those other sci-fi films that seem to be wholly about lasers and do-dads and weird looking aliens.  See, I never liked science fiction.  I found it to be too nerdy, lacking heart and soul, more concerned with gadgetry and amazingly complicated story lines and stuff I just couldn't relate to.  What I didn't realize is that there is sci-fi for me
 Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux star in George Pal's  The Time Machine , a great sci fi movie based on the novel by H.G. Wells. Taylor plays George an inventor in the late 18th century (1899 to be exact) who makes a machine that can go back in time. At first his colleagues are skeptical, but when they see George's small model machine that goes back in time, they start to believe him. George's best friend, and supporter is David played by Alan Young. George takes the machine back, because he is sick of the present time, with war being brought on. He travels to the early and middle 1900's and to his shock , George finds out that Man's future lies in war (which is pretty accurate even up to today's time). He sees how WWI and WWII started, and even sees when his house is destroyed by an enemy plane! George then travels far into the future, the year 802701, to see if mankind has any hope of living in peace. At first, he sees a great paradise with many people (mostly children) play about in solitude. But when one lady named Weena, starts to drown, he sees that no one seems to care. He rescues her, and after talking to the other youths, he learns that they learned nothing from their ancient ancestors. The books they have are old and buried. They have lived the good the life, based on the sacrifices from mankind, and they don't appreciate it (which is another accurate telling of today's times). He learns that Weena is part of the Eloi society which is under the slavery of the Morlocks, a cannibalistic race. The Morlocks give everything, food and clothing to the Eloi , in exchange for the slavery and their bodies as food. The movie was directed by sci fi whiz George Pal who won an impressive 7 oscars and awards for his movies. He is the Steven Spielberg when it comes to sci fi movies. What's astonishing about the film is the special effects that were made without computer help (which in most movies make the movie look more fake than real). The way the special effects people made flowers bloom, candles burn while the Time Machine went in time, is very special to see. It's a great site, from a special effects view, how these people managed to do these effects, with the limited resources they had. He directed  War of the Worlds  and  Destination Moon  which won numerous awards. DVD comes with a number of great features
 There are a lot of reviews about this great picture and how it influenced an entire generation. All of it is true! For some reason this film ties into the imagination and fills you with wonder. We can thank Mr. Wells for creating the story, but we really owe it to George Pal, Wah Chang and Gene Warren for translating the book into a miracle of romantic adventure. The real draw of course is  The Time Machine  prop. Never in the history of film has a prop been more imitated and desired. The special effects received an Academy Award and it was well deserved. All of the elements of Victorian London in winter, cozy parlors surrounded with friends gathered for dinner,  tea table  chat over the 4th dimension and the recollection of an experiment in time travel utilizing a flashback technique are what makes this film so enchanting. When Rod Taylor finally begins a slow initial journey we see the sky in motion in day and night sequences that are breathtaking in astronomic splendor. As the flowered garden and fruit trees go through their seasonal cycles in rapid progression you cannot help but be drawn into the wonder of creation and the genius of invention! The screenwriters then play with your imagination as we see our traveler stop at different events in our 20th century past and a  cold war  interpretation of the decade in which it was filmed when he stops in the  future  on August 18th, 1966 to witness a nuclear holocaust. From here we are quickly transported to the focal point of the Wells story to a future society of Eloi and Morlock culture. The care that went into this DVD should not be understated. It is a highly polished film that restores 20/20 vision to the frames so that we can see all of the colorful beauty that was originally there. Once again, we can SEE the atomic satellite zeroing in, the clear sky above the Eloi  cafeteria  and the smoking machinery of the Morlock caverns. When our traveler returns to 1899 and presents the flower to Filby that was given to him by Weena you will agree that  that flower could not have possibly bloomed in the winter time  and in the holding of that flower you will realize that this is a magic moment in film that will be with you forever and as Mrs. Watchit gradually turns off the lights in our view from the snowy evening outside you will think about the three books you would have taken and agree that having seen this film you will never be the same again, because you are in love with a romantic idea, TIME TRAVEL.
 Another trip back in time (sorry about that) for a fine movie.  There's someting in all of us that we would love to escape and go back to simpler times.  Back To The Future was also a trip to a more innocent era that I miss.  What ever happened to Mayberry?
 This is a great anniversary edition of this sci-fi classic, however, the seller failed to do a quality check before shipping. The case was damaged inside and a piece of the plastic was rubbing on the recorded side od the DVD making scratches all over. The quality of the video was then, of course, damaged also. Lesson
 I first saw this movie when I was a young chap. The time travel concept greatly appealed to me then (you have to appreciate the standard of sci-fi movies of the time) and still holds a nostalgic charm for me today at sixty-seven years old. Yea! It has been beautifully restored and looks just like it did back then. (maybe even better). Gorgeous period feel. The machine is magnificent and Rod is the mans' man. I'm not too sure about the special features, a bit hammy and unnecessary, although the machine's reclamation was interesting and the special effects techniques fascinating. I may be a bit of geek, but this DVD is one of my all-time sci fi favorites.
 I love the old movies of the past, and this one is at top of my list. The quality of picture, sound and color is beyond my best hopes. I feel sorry for the people who give this on less than five stars, if there were ten, i would give them.
 this is a great movie classic.  good suspence and even the graphics are great for the time period.  this is movie that you could watch over and over
 Great 60's Sci-Fi movie!  Saw this in the movies with my dad when it 1st came out and have it on DVD.  Just wish it was offered in Blu-Ray.  I'd snap it up in a second.
 I have enjoyed watching this movie ever since it came out. First time was in black and white. Makes one think about how things could turn out.
 Although this movie was made in 1960, it will hold you attention. It is exciting at how the author imagined what thousands of years into the future might look like! Enjoy!
 I read this book when I was a child and have always loved the story.  This film version is a very good retelling of the H.G. Wells Classic tale.  Rod Taylor does a very good job as the Time Traveler (who in the novel is unnamed, but is called George in the film), and a young, beautiful Yvette Mimieux is well-cast as Weena the child-like woman of the far distant future.  The Special Effects done by George Pal demonstrate his usual excellent work.  They are a little dated, but taking into consideration that the film was made in the early 1960's they are outstanding for the time.  The Morlocks look a little cheesy, but if one ignores these minor details, the film is a real treat.  After seeing this film countless times, I am thrilled to be able to share it with my grandchildren.  This film stays more or less true to the book by H.G. Wells and is a classic just like the book.  I am sure that Sci-Fi fans like myself will enjoy this film.  It is definitely worth the five star rating that I gave it.
 This is a great movie & has been updated considerably (visually) over the original. The quality of the image is much better & more clear. It's the same original movie but even more enjoyable to watch now. The DVD I received is perfect quality for a used movie. I highly recommend used movies from Amazon. They are great to replace older movies on VCR tape. The prices are very good.
 Classic telling of H.G. Wells's masterpiece. I would recommened this product to any fan of classic sci-fi. I do like the recent rendition, but will never beat the classic.
 This show is still one of the best movies I have ever enjoyed,top 5,(the book is great too),it is a true classic and a fantastic story!! I saw it at the old Avalon theater in Chicago,when it first came out,it was out of sight then & it still is.Good old memories.Enjoy it.
 Rod Taylor builds a time machine and travels forward in time, seeing vast social change, war, and eventually winding up tens of thousands of years in the future. He finds himself in a devolved world, where humans (the eloi) are mere cattle, living in ignorant bliss. They are food for the race of subterranean mutants (morlocks) that lord over them. Can Taylor's character help these doomed folks? Classic stuff!...
 One of George Pal's greatest films.  Rod Taylor travels through time to try to find a utopian world of peace and love.  Yvette Mimieux makes Marilyn Monroe look ugly. Great fun and adventure.
 Really Great to see this clasic again. Arrived in good time, no defects and good condition. thank you
 Rod Taylor is at his best in the HG Wells Classic.  Good film and the storyline is very close to the novel.  I wished that they would have made Time Machine II.  They had a script for the film but was never produced.  This one is better than the one that was remade in 2002.
 This is a great movie for anyone that enjoys old movies.  Not to mention Arlene Dahl is just beautiful!
 Director George Pal will probably be more remembered for this film than any of his other classics, including  Giant.   Why?  Remember, this is 1960, and whether or not Pal's version is true to Wells' book is not the issue.  Marvel at the unique special effects, including the mannequin's many transformations, the way the clouds scurry across the window; the lush but sterile world of the eloi and morlocks.  This is quite groundbreaking in the world of cinema, long before the CGI and animatronics guys came along.  Rod Taylor (The Birds, TV's Falcon Crest) is the perfect studly hero, but he also possesses a sensitivity uncommon in movies of the 60s, which is all more evident in his friendship with the delightful Alan Young (Tom Thumb, Mr. Ed).  Add a trio of our most respected character actors (Sebastian Cabot, Whit Bissell and Tom Helmore) to lend upper crust credence.  And how can one forget the lovely Yvette Mimieux.  Yvette came to audiences attentions in a two part Dr. Kildare episode. She played his love interest, a surfer with elilepsy, who dies in the final moments.  She also played the troubled young girl in  Where the Boys Are  and in the 1970s starred in a rarely known cult classic,  Hit Lady.   Her beautiful innocence is captured in this movie. Yes, it's campy, a little corny in its naivete about man's future, but as a scifi film, it's one of the best and far surpasses its glitzy remake with Guy Pearce.
 filby plays a good role in this film
 I enjoy viewing movies that I remember as a child. These movies are clean cut. The movie in dvd format had great quality.
 THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC FROM THE SIXTIES. GOOD ACTION, WELL MADE, THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE
 This is the ultimate in classic sci-fi. Even though the special effects pale in comparison to today's standards, I like it better than the remake.  This is the story of H.G. Wells, told as a recounting of his visit nearly a million years into the future in a time machine he has constructed. The film differs from the book in a few ways, but they are mostly because the original book was written long before the creation of the atomic bomb, and that in the 50's when the film was made, everyone was paranoid of nuclear attack.  The DVD version has some great behind the scenes and 'making of' featurettes. If you are a fan of classic sci-fi, this is a must-have.  At the end of the film, Wells goes back to the future time, and the only thing that he appears to have taken are visible as two empty spaces on his bookshelf. The question is, which two books would you take?
 Super fast delivery! Love this movie.  my only pet peeve is that the dvd was loose in the case due to rough handling while in shipment...but no scratches no worries!
 The DVD is excellent.  DVD was received in excellent condition and before expected delivery date.
 The Time Machine is a Science Fiction classic. George Pal too H.G. Wells&#65533;s classic story and made it a reality. From the costumes to the intricately detailed Time Machine itself, the movie is a stand out in special effects, art direction and make-up. Rod Taylor was fantastic and played his character with a real sense of amazement. (If you have seen the new version &#65533; it lacks a real important element &#65533; characters anyone cares about.) This movie has a charm and romance that Yvette Mimoeux could only portray. Even George Pal&#65533;s visions of what the 80&#65533; and 90&#65533;s would be like are not far off. Who could forget the classic mannequin in the window sequence &#65533; watching fashion styles change before our eyes. The key to most of the special effects in the film was of course &#65533; stop motion animation. Whereby, elements and props and sets are shot one frame at a time while slight movements were made between each exposed frame. Thanks to CGI technology these days &#65533; this has almost become a lost art form. When it is done well, like in this movie &#65533; it really is effective and shines. The DVD extras on this one are great. A television retrospective shot in the mid 90&#65533;s with some of the original cast is really well done. The behind the scenes and event he history of what happened to the original Time Machine are on this documentary. This is a must DVD for Science Fiction fans. A true classic and a very good DVD for anyone's collection.
 IN A NUTSHELL
 My title says it all.I don't care if I'm from The Matrix and Star Wars generation,I loved this movie alot more then the 2002 remake.I think George Pal was the Steven Spielberg of his time.It's a great masterpiece,Rod Taylor was perfect as the time travller and it was a total blast watching him go forward in time.In the remake it was a total of 10 minutes of him going though time and in the orgainal,it's about half and hour.So to the people of my generation,skip the remake and watch the Pal classic instead. ***** out of *****
 Just finished watching this sci-fi classic! The picture quality has been masterfully restored as well as the audio content, and The Time Machine has never looked better!!!! The story of a young Victorian Era scientist who succeeds in conquering the most elusive of all man's quests....Time travel! His journey into the Fourth dimension propels the viewer into a fantastic vision of the future of mankind! In the year, 802,701A.D. George, the Time Traveler(portrayed marvelously by Rod Taylor), encounters a nuclear-war resulting divison of the human species...the passive, surface-dwelling Eloi race and the subterranean, cannibalistic predators, the Morlocks! In a race to save the human remnants from complete extinction by the creatures of twilight in this strange world, George must use his wits and strength in an all out battle which will decide Mankind's fate!  Skillfully directed by George Pal (who also produced), this film stands as one of the most outstanding science-fiction films ever made, paving the way for imitations in the years following its initial release! Full of incredible, Academy Award-winning special effects (Gene Warren and Wah Chang, and the talents of Projects Unlimited), it holds it own against the computer-generated films of today !!! of compelling interest is the Time Machine vehicle itself, one of my favorite movie props!!! With a veteran supporting cast led by Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot and newcomer, Yvette Mimieux, this is one film that is in a word.... timeless! Favorably recommended and considered to be an all-time classic! Great viewing for any sci-fi fan! Based upon H.G. Wells' immortal novel...The Time Machine...his first and best work!
 Star Trek bores me, and Star Wars doesn't do much for me either. So that disqualifies me from being a Sci-Fi geek. That being said, I've reviewed a handful of movies on Amazon, but I've never reviewed my favorite of all time. Year after year, this one stands out
 I always loved this movie since the first time I saw it when I was 6 years old.  I remember taking a small toy car and sticking a little umbrella in the back to make it look like the Time Machine. This DVD is really incredible!  What they did to the soundtrack is great.  The movie sounds great in 5.1 and remember this movie is a 40 year old movie.  FOX should have taken lessons before the did Planet of the Apes in 5.1 (if you can call it that!) Picture quality is superb.  But I do agree with another reviewer that the DVD cover could have been better, but I do see that another BOX set version of this movie is coming out this month with alot more goodies!
 The 1960 film version of "The Time Machine", was always one of my absolute favourites growing up and rewatching it now as an adult I appreciate now even more the great effort put in by the legendary George Pal and his talented cast and technical crew in bringing this story vividly to life. Their attention to detail, and creation of what are still awe inspiring special effects were of course created using their collective imaginations without the help of today's computers. I'm not going into exclamations as others have about the effects appearing "dated", by today's standards as that is a pointless exercise and really why is there a need to compare efforts such as this made in 1960 with the technology available to movie makers today? I look at the film in the context of the time it was made in and in this way it can be seen that "The Time Machine", was very state of the art entertainment upon its release. Using the excellent literary source in the famous novel by H.G. Wells, MGM studios in a last gasp of its famous move making finesse fashioned an exciting, thought provoking, and above all else spectacular story here that looks as fresh today as it did over 45 years ago. What is so totally impressive about this film version still for me is the marvellous depiction of the passage of time once the story gets under way and this progression by Rod Taylor on his time machine from New Years Eve 1899 through many thousands of years into Earth's future is still one of the greatest science fiction sequences ever filmed in any decade. George Pal's brilliance in visual design is wonderfully evident in every frame of these scenes where he shows the passing of time by the continual speeded up rising and setting of the sun and moon and best of all by a wonderful idea of continually showing the clothes on a mannequin standing in a neighboring shop window continually changing as the fashions progress over many decades. The time machine itself is a wonderful piece of movie making design and in the decades since the film's release has really taken on a whole life of its own as probably one of the most famous movie props ever created. For all sci fi film lovers like myself this wonderful piece of imaginative construction along with the whole classic movie to which it belongs has assumed an appropriately timeless quality and illustrates yet again the genius that was movie maker George Pal.
 In the 1960's, when movie making was still an art form, master puppeteer, George Pal created what has been considered a true classic, The Time Machine. Selecting as his hero, the handsome, gritty and debonair Austrialian actor Rod Taylor, playing Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays the adventurous, but moody, Victorian as a gentleman, who dabbles with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live in. Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date, Pal launches Taylor into the future. Stopping only to observe the changing eras where war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi. Here he meets beautiful and sultry Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and her people. During their brief time together, Weena allows Wells to learn that despite their idyllic paradise, it is not without dangers. In this future, it's the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells' time machine. Doomed to spend eternity in the future, Taylor engages in battle with the Morlocks resulting in a story he will later relate to David Filby (Alan Young) and his Victorian friends. The film is superb and despite being remade several times, has never been equaled. H.G. Wells would have approved.  *****
 "The Time Machine", is one of the many movies that when it was made was in danger of not living up to the expectations of many.  There were those who love H.G. Wells and wanted an acurate portrayal of his work.  There were those who liked science fiction and fantasy movies and wanted it to fit into that segment of cinema.  It was going to be difficult to please everyone, but amazingly it did.  The idea of using time travel in movies has been done and redone; I think of the movies "Back to the Future", "Peggy Sue got Married", and many many more, but for me this is one of the better done ones, because  1st.  The movie talks about searching for a greater good.  It's not just a story of humor, or vaneness, or someone trying to get out of trouble.  In other words, there is much more at stake in this movie.  It's a movie about one man searching for answers that are bigger than himself.  I can totally relate to this.  Let me be honest and say this is a thinking mans movie.  Yes, you can just simply watch and enjoy, but if that is all you do you have missed out on so much.  We are meant to watch this movie, and then meditate on it.  To see ourselves in the characters.  2nd.  the director could have made this movie in a number of ways, but the direction is superb, and I loved the special effects.  The scenes when the inventor is still in his lab watching the first half of the 20th century go by is great!  I really enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette on the movie that is presented by Rod Taylor.  The part of what happened to the actual machine after the movie is both interesting and sad.  This movie is leaps and bounds better than the newer version of "The Time Machine".  Don't miss this jewel.
 I have always been a fan of classic horror and sci-fi, but this was a movie I have always slept on. I never watched it, I thought it wasn't my type of movie. I wasn't planning on watching it, I heard how good it was, but it never came across me. One day at the store I picked it up on dvd, I popped it in the player and wow was I amazed. This movie never slows down, it's really entertaining and makes you ponder about the the future and the posibility of time travel. Of course not through that type of device he used but just time traveling general. The scenery is stunning and the effects are pleasing. Nobody has the right to dislike this movie, the story is great, the events that happen during the film are interesting and you won't be stopping it while your watching it. Nearly everyone who put down this movie either had problems with the visual/audio or have a very short attention span and no imagination. The morlocs are one race you won't forget and the same goes for the main character and his stunning lady from the future Weena, I believe that was her name. Watching this and getting back to regular life is hard because it makes life seem so dull and boring, it leaves you curious and wanting more. That's what a film should do to someone, this is a classic and in my eyes one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Great for the whole family, this is a must-have whether you're into science fiction or not. One of the most memorable films I've seen in my life! Fantastic!
 If you asked me what my two favorite science-fiction movies were, I'd have to say Forbidden Planet and The Time Machine. As anyone who has read the book can tell you, it's not the kind of story that really lends itself to a movie. Why? Well... The book was about the seperation of the social classes. About the futility of human achievement, and ultimately, about how human kindness is the one thing that survives when all else is lost. In that story, one human being was just a cog in the wheel of time, and had little power to change anything. But the movie...ah the movie was about something else entirely. Look past the excellent special effects and the (in my book anyway) great acting and flow of plot. What do you have? A story about the suffering of humanity. The striving for knowledge and improvement. And the idea that if people allow themselves to stagnate, to become complacent, and to forget the mistakes of the past, they may allow their world to turn into a nightmare rather than the Utopia they long for. In this movie, one human being CAN make a difference. The time traveler helps the people of the future to rediscover their courage, their compassion, their humanity. As long as one person still clings to the ideals of humanity, there is always hope. This is a great movie, and the dvd certainly does it justice. It features one of the nicest film transfers I have ever seen. The picture quality is absolutely perfect, and the widescreen is really appreciated. If you are a sci-fi fan, or a movie buff, you NEED to own this movie. It IS different from the book. But it has merits of it's own. And they are not to be overlooked.
 Since I saw this movie as a kid, it has always been one of my all-time favorites.  The story has a charm, that transcends time and it still remains thoroughly entertaining.  The only video copy I had in my personal library was one that I taped from tv.  Boy, was I in for a surprise when I viewed my new DVD version.  It is stunning!  I must commend those who worked on the restoration...it is gorgeous.  It makes some newer movies that have been transferred to DVD, look sick.  At times, I forgot I was looking at a movie that is over 40 years old.  I found myself noticing details of the sets that I never saw before. If there is any drawback, it would be that the clarity of the picture brings attention to some matte paintings that were less than convicing. I love this movie and this DVD version has renewed my enthusiasm and made me realize that it really is one of my favorite movies.
 A good movie for it's time and a good movie now. So much better than the cheesy remake.
 For old time classic sci-fi it doesn't get any better than this. I remember watching this film as a boy and it's still great even now. Please remember that the special effects are not as sophisticated as they are today but the story line and characters are great. An added bonus is that the digitally enhanced version for DVD is "OUTSTANDING"! This picture is as crisp and clear as it gets and is hard to believe the film itself was made in 1960. The special bonus features are also equally excellent with a few of the original stars of the film appearing some 30 years later with some neat surprises about the film. If you like science fiction than this film is a "Must Have".
 I realy love this movie.I can recall the first time i saw it as a kid.I thought it was brilliant at the time,and this movie stands the test of time.I didnt watch all of the new version of the movie,but what i did see i didnt like.I think a movie like this is hard to make a better version of.  The effects they used in the movie were alot different to the methods they use today.But were very effective and obviously it took alot of time to do.It was facinating the way they made the snail race by with time lapse pictures,amongst other things like the sun racing over.  Its the sort of fantasy movie i think anyone can relate to.I often think what would i do with such a machine.  Rod Taylor was brilliant in his role.Very convincing.  The age of this movie and how even the young genneration can be equally facinated by it,proves what a great movie this is.  There are very good extras with this DVD.  An inventor(Rod Taylor), builds a time machine and travels through time. He sees both WWI and WWII as well as 1968 during the Cold War in which he experiences a nuclear bomb. The movie really gets going when he travels far into the future to a time when people are ruled by Morlocks, cannibalistic creatures who basically breed humans so they can eat them. Seeing how horrible it is, the inventor tries to free them from the Morlocks.  If its an exciting movie you are after,get this.
 You know something, the Eloi remind me of myself. They are disorientated, not knowing what the hell is going on, and just going places they just don't wanna go, but go, because they don't know that they don't want to go to that place they are going to!!! Read it again, it'll make sense.  This movie is the best of the best when it comes to time travel flicks. George Pal couldn't have done a better book to film transfer. Music is eerie and Roddy taylor is perfect as the time traveller and is believable as a 19th century inventor. Watch the Documentary on DVD, it's presented by Roddy and is over 45mins long. A must watch. This is top of my list. A real gem. But I would still rather travel in time in a car, than a sofa chair, that looks like my grannys.
 George Pal was the man who brought us the science fiction classics "When Worlds Collide and "The War of the Worlds".  George did an equally good job with "The Time Machine". Herbert Wells wonders about the evolution of society and looks forward into the future at the great things man will accomplish.  The drive to see that great future has driven Herbert to create a machine to get there.  One aspect I enjoyed about this movie and "Time after Time is that Herbert in each movie was interested in the progress of society and man.  Their action with the time machine was the equivalent of turning to the last chapter of a novel. In this movie, Herbert finds that society has been destroyed by a nuclear war, which in 1960 seemed like a very real and imminent possibility.  Mankind was driven underground by the need to escape the effects of the war, leading ultimately to the evolution of the peaceful Eloi and the predatory Morlocks.  The Morlocks principal source of food seems to be the Eloi, while the Eloi eat fruits and vegetables, which inadvertently becomes a commentary on what happens to vegetarians. George Pal tries hard and generally succeeds in exploiting what happens when a society no longer has a need to drive itself to achieve a goal, whatever that goal may be.  The Eloi have everything provided, so they see no need to strive to be any different.  Things are the way they have always been, and life if good.  If some disappear occasionally, well, we can still go play by the rocks and do whatever.  Obviously some of this story is difficult to believe because we know that even "peaceful animals such as rams and bulls sometimes fight to the [end] over females and territory, and it would seem like there would be some point of contention even in this "perfect society.  However, given that the movie has to present a viewpoint in a relatively small time frame, it succeeds well by the very exaggeration of the characteristics of such a society. The end of the movie is most satisfying, as Alan Young (playing George Well's best friend Philby), speculates on three books that George took with him to help re-build the civilization of the far future. While the movie suffers from many of the cliches and the now dated styling of the late 1950s, it creates a very believably little tale with award winning special effects.  At the end of the movie you are left with the sense that mankind has the ability to triumph over the odds.  I am admittedly partial to these classics, which did so much with so little, requiring much plot creativity.  However, when the end credits roll, you walk out satisfied that you were treated to a real movie experience. While I should give this movie 4 stars for its weak points, it gets 5 stars for standing the tests of time and being better than the 2002 re-make.
 Well, I think that this was probably the only movie I ever watched as a junior high and high school student.  At least it seemed this way.  And I was addicted to the book--reading it in the bathtub, etc.  But that is a different review! My only copy was a static-ladened VCR tape I got off of the local UHF. It was absolutely stunning to see the film in a clear letter-boy, plus to see the missing scenes that were cut out due to time constraints.  Wonderful! Yes the effects are cheesy, and WWIII in 1966 is dated, but still . . . give it a break.   1984  was off, but we still read the book! This DVD has the complete film, and it is a good transfer, except for one or two scenes which seem a little fuzzy.  The sound is tops! The great bonus was the  Making of . . .   This segment is a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie, with a special segment!  Rod Taylor (George) and Alan Young (Filby) filmed an addendum to the film, and it is an almost perfect continuation and conclusion to the film! This was the first DVD I ever owned.  I love it!  Just the thought of traveling thorough time appeals to me.  that is probably why I am a historian!
 No doubt about it, it's still the best and my favorite all-time movie. I only wish there would be a true sequel made based on George Pal's "The Time Machine 2 novel. Keeping to the same look and style while incorporating modern special effects, it would be a success. Of course, there would have to be different actors playing the roles after all these years,  but it could be done. Incidentally, I'd like to mention Don Coleman's site has the BEST site on The Time Machine in all it's aspects (that's colemanzone.com). I think his forum had some technical problems for a while, but it's ok now.  One more thought; when are we going to see the blu ray?
 The first thing I have to say about the film is that it tries to follow the book up to a point.  But in order to make a film for the big screen they had to add just a detail here and there and, of course, a love interest.  With actors like Rod Taylor, Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux in a film by George Pal you really can't go wrong.  Actions, adventure, special effects! The extra is a long feature mostly focused on the Time Machine, how it was made and what happened to it during and after the film. A must for any fan of H.G. Wells and sci-fi.
 In the 1950s, director George Pal was best known for producing the film version of  The War of the Worlds  and for creating his numerous  Puppetoons  a decade earlier. Pal would go on to make  The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao  in 1964, but his most thoughtful film (in my opinion) will forever be  The Time Machine .  Going back to H.G. Wells, Pal insures a Victorian sentimentality that would've been present if the film had been made during the era in which it was written. Taking place on the literal eve of the new (20th) century, inventor George (Rod Taylor) invites a group of his friends to witness a demonstration of his new invention. When they arrive, they don't believe in the Time Machine that he has created. Even his best friend, Filby (delightfully played by Alan Young) has his doubts. Uninterested, they leave him to celebrate the new era.  Determined to travel through time, George uses the machine himself to find what's left of human civilization in the far future. (After fleeing World Wars and puzzling fashons.) He expects to find a Utopia, and he finds one of sorts - but it is not the paradise he expected. George discovers he must defend and teach these valueless humans (including the beautiful Weena played by Yvette Mimieux), lest they die out forever.  The film is an allegory for the rapidly diminishing Victorian mentality at the turn of the century, and George finds that his imagination and spirit of adventure are outdated within his own lifetime.  The Time Machine  not only reflects the spirit of Wells' own work but the swashbuckling fiction of the time, made whole with a sense of hope and empathy representing the perfect Victorian gentleman hero. This really is 19th Century science fiction at its best
 H.G.Welles Time Machine is a great Sci-Fi film that everyone must see. Perhaps the special effects are a bit dated,but ahead of it's time when made. Its' theme speaks to the path of destruction that man has taken on its march through time. Thanks to Amazon for pricing this movie so we can all enjoy its message.Good luck to the Eloi.
 What a great movie. Rod Taylor Takes HG Well's George the main charactor through time. He tries to find a better world. Yet as far as you  can go things remain the same. The special effects for the 60's was great. HG Wells was showing how he felt about society. Making the rich useless Eloi and the working people doing the work the monster Morlocks. Just sit back and enjoy a fun movie with great actors that you can feel that they were the charactors from the book. This movie was charming, exciting and a true classic. See it.
 A thousand times better than the recent remake.  Don't bother with that one. This is the definitive movie.  I watched this with my 22 year old daughter who is studying animation.  She agreed with me that George Pal's 1960 animation was as good as anything in the new version.  The story was far better presented. and the additional 30 minute special feature with brings Rod Taylor and Alan Young back together again 30+ years later was far more enjoyable than most 'making of' features.
 I saw this as a boy and it permanently entered my imagination.  If there was one wish that I could have had, it would have been to have a real machine like the one in the film.  I added the film to my collection so that I could share it with my children.  Watching it at this age, I must say that there is still magic to it.  In particular, the sense of history passing so quickly, seeing where the path of man might lead.  The scientist truly still captured my imagination - his inspiration, his wonder, his hopes, his regrets, his struggle against smaller minds.  That part worked for me as it did in 1964, when I first saw it.  I also enjoyed his discovery and investigation of the Eloi, who to his horror had devolved into passive children living only in the present, using only present-tense verbs.  Unfortunately, the part with the Morlocks appeared preposterous and crude to me, a kind of tack-on to the great first hour of the movie, to make it an action movie in its last 25 minutes.  It is fun, of course, but there is nothing distinguished about it and the end resolution is way too pat.  And my kids (g14 & b10).  With the special effects nearly 50 years old, they were not impressed.  They also did not get swept up in the themes the way I did, again with a mix of sophistication and impatience with the slower pace (the Star Wars infection, I would call that).  But we did discuss it, even if they laughed at it for the most part.  The extras of my edition are also OK.  Though the documentary has too much about the fate of the prop time machine, there is also a fictional vignette conclusion that is truly worth the price of admission.  Warmly recommended.  I guess I'm dated in my kids' eyes, but I am still a sucker for it and glad of it!
 I've always loved this movie from the time I was a kid.  One funny thing I noticed that I never noticed before is in the underworld fight scene.  Just before the Eloi start heading up from the Morlock's underworld area, watch the dead Morlock in the sitting position.  He moves his leg out of the way so the Eloi can run past him.  What a considerate corpse.
 The Time Machine is a classic, period.  I will not go into the details of the movie as many other reviewers have already done so (great good vs. evil).  Warner Brothers came out with the stellar Ultimate Forbidden Planet, complete with a model of the robot and tin box!  How cool would it be to have the same for the Time Machine (like maybe, a model of the time machine???)  These two movies (in Ultimate editions) are the best bookends your DVD library could ever have.
 "The Time Machine is a classic sci-fi story which has spawned a myriad of other time travel scenarios, the two most recognizable being "The Time Tunnel", and "Quantum Leap".This movie stands the test of time (pardon the obvious pun).It is expertly paced, and draws the viewer right into the story.You almost get a feel for the past,present and future.You also hear Wells' ominous predictions for what is now a very real and quite alarming present.His stories have always exposed the worst of our natures, whether self-created or from outside, yet preach that we are the ones who control our destiny, and that there is always hope.This movie can and should be viewed several times each year. I guarantee you will thoroughly enjoy it as much on the tenth or even twentieth time as in the first.
 A must have for lovers of H. G. Wells, or even Jules Vern, or classic Science Fiction movies.  Well played, by the actors, and full of suspense.  Believeable, and almost comical, as it may predict our furture.  What will our post nuclear age be like, will we ever use the bomb again?  What will be the results?  Even a few flashes of the past, and somehow defines the future, as explained by the "The Time Traveler", or is it.  Love Science Fiction, classic Science Fiction, then pick up a copy, pop some corn turn out the lights and prepare to be jolted, just a little.
 I first saw this movie when I was a little kid, and have watched it at least thirty times since, it had a great impact on my life. The special effects leave a little to be desired, compared to a 'modern' flick, but it's a classic that belongs in everyone's movie library.
 I can't say enough about this film version of H.G. Wells'  Time Machine,  as opposed to the newly remade version with Guy Pearce (which I don't recommend, by the way).  Rod Taylor makes for the PERFECT lead character
 It's about time! No pun intended. I saw this on TV when I was less than 10 years old, and I never forgot it - the image of that Victorian design time machine with the revovling disk is burned into my head. Imagine my joy when  I saw it being used as the time machine in Carl Sagan's COSMOS TV series  (now *there's* another that deserves DVD treatment). George Pal outdoes  himself, with an story that's surprisingly faithtful to the spirit of the  original Wells novel - with romance, adventure, and visions of the future  thrown in, right down to a nuclear war in the 1980s and lava filling the  streets. One of the best things about the DVD format is the behind the  scenes features you can tag onto classic movies - sadly, not all movie  releases do this. Where's the commented versions of War of the Worlds,  Forbidden Planet - and when can we get The Day The Earth Stood Still  and  When Worlds Collide? Come on - there's tons of us SF movie geeks out there.  Feed us!
 This is still the classic movie - saw it as a pre-teen and loved it then and it still brings back memories - the newer version does not compare with this classic - would not recomend it for small children
 Beautiful conversion of a clean film to DVD, nicely presented, well organized, lots of interesting background information.
 In order for a science fiction movie to seem plausible, it needs more than special effects wizardry, evil villains, or even a handsome hero (although all three do not hurt).  It needs at its core, a hero who resonates with the audience, one in whom they can identify because he acts believably, if not heroically.  In George Pal's THE TIME MACHINE, the time traveller George (Rod Taylor) can put the audience at ease with a smile or gentlemanly act of gallantry and can in a flash revert to the traditional role of derring doer whenever a pretty damsel is in need.  The recent (2002) version of this film with Guy Pearce in the title role has too much of special effects and not enough of the hero.  George Pal wisely allows his time traveller not to play second banana to the then (1960) special effects that wowed the viewer without distracting him.   George is a scientist who on the last day of the 19th century wishes to prove to his circle of doubting friends that time travel is not only possible but practicable.  There is a charming scene in which he lectures to them on the fourth dimension, culminating with a mini-time machine model that takes a cigar to the future.  This scene functions as a necessary segue to the larger model that will carry him to his unknown future.  Alan Young and Sebastian Cabot have minor but significant roles in that they set the tone that this movie is more about the relationships between people than it is between man and novel technology. George zooms to the far future where he encounters a race of humans (the Eloi) who have degenerated morally into a blandly hedonistic group of blonde but not too adventuresome weaklings who are opposed by equally degenerate atavistic green-skinned Neanderthals who see the Eloi only as food.  This division of humanity into opposite sides of the same Jekyll and Hyde persona forces George into an ugly choice
 I definitely recommend this movie!!! It has a good story line from the beginning to the end... you will not be disappointed!!!
 Maybe it's because I think of this version as the standard against which all other Time Machine movies must be compared. I just enjoy it.  It was a great introduction to the idea of relativity for my 8th graders.  They really got into it.
 The Time Machine (1960)was an excellent five star movie produced by George Pal starring Rod Taylor. This old movie has held up pretty well with the passage of much time.  I first saw it at the Loews Paradise in the Bronx back in 1960. Many of my old friends from the neighborhood took the trek up to Fordham Road to see this movie with me and were not dissapointed with this great film. Although the special effects are a little dated they are nevertheless still effective.  The movie owes much of its success to the original Wells story.
 This is one of the best movies ever made. This isn't just a classic, this movie is one of the movies that paved the way for other sci fi movies. This is as much of a classic as Wizard of Oz or Gone with the Wind and in my opinion this is better than both of those movies put together.
 The Time Machine is a true classic film that is an adventure in time, past present and future. I highly recommend it!
 An absolutely brilliant exposition of HG Wells famous novel.It really does explain what time is,and is very educative for budding students of Physics ! The sets are very well laid out ,the acting brilliant.It certainly adheres to the plot much better than the 2002 version and I would recommend it strongly to all those who are interested in Sci Fi and the subject of time travel
 "The Time Machine is as far as I'm concerned George Pal's best movie.  Released in 1960, it stars Rod Taylor as the time traveler `George'.  George is an inventor in 1899.  In an gathering of his friends, he demonstrates a scale model of what he says is a time machine.  Except for his friend Filby  (played by a finely nuanced Alan Young) those gathered don't believe him.  Unsuspected by all but Filby, George has built a full-scale model.  After his guests leave, he's off.......  The set design is brilliant.  The time machine itself is the coolest thing made by genuine imitation Hollywood Victorian  craftsman.  A nice touch is the nameplate on the control panel.  It says, "Built by H. George Wells".  The special effects were state-of-the-art for 1960 winning an Academy Award for best special effects.  Even today, the effects fit neatly into the story.  This is a mid-twentieth century cinematic interpretation of a nineteenth century novel.  The David Duncan screenplay `updates' the story brilliantly. While George Pal's films have a well-deserved reputation for technical excellence, the acting has been uneven.  That is not the case in this movie.  Mr. Taylor is totally believable as the idealistic inventor searching for a better world.  Yvette Mimieux is Weena, of the sheep-like Eloi who begins to think as result of meeting George.  The DVD I have has an excellent documentary on the making of the film narrated by Mr. Taylor.  If you interested in a great SF adventure movie, this one is essential to your collection.
 This is the book Sylvester McCoy is reading as 1996's DOCTOR WHO---THE MOVIE begins. This is just before he regenerates into Paul McGann and just before Eric Roberts gives  what was (up to that time) his greatest performance on film as "The Master.  (In case you haven't noticed I am trying to work a mention of DOCTOR WHO into almost every review I write---just KIDDING).  ANYWAY---yup that's the devastatingly sexy Rod Taylor as "George (who seems to be intended as a film portrayal of author Herbert GEORGE Wells---but if he IS then he couldn't have written the book on which the movie is based because the second time he goes...er...BACK to the future---he doesn't return. He TELLS the story to his friends (including Alan "A Horse is a Horse of Course of Course Young---but he doesn't WRITE it---thereby creating a problem in temporal logic only someone from Gallifrey---or possibly someone from a small planet in orbit around Betelgeuse---instead of Guildford---in Surrey---as they had previously CLAIMED---could POSSIBLY solve---anyway Rod's character doesn't actually HAVE a name in the book---he's just "The Time Traveller".  Yvette Mimieux (whom I could never HELP calling Yvette Meow-Meow) is on hand looking pretty devastatingly sexy herself as Weena---and the Morlocks are suitably scary.  The Time Machine itself (which makes a guest appearance in <a href="http
 Another classic which was re-made in an extremely disappointing attempt. The original has not and probably will never be surpassed.  This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies of its time.  Again, great special effects for the time period.  And again, while it can't compare to the technology of today, its much more raw emotion, feeling and truth.  Newer versions tend to be changed for the time in which it is being released.  It just discredits the original.  I would love to see a classic like this remade almost exactly the way the original was done but with the special effects of today.
 I was very delighted to see Hollywood had saved this old film classic with Rod Taylor.  I especially enjoyed the behind the scenes portion and learned allot about this film's history, since its making.  I had even had the pleasure of working along side Mr. Bob Burns, while working as forman of Magic Mountain's Showcase Theatre, located in Valencia, California some 30 years ago.  Mr. Burns was a interesting man to meet and be around; always full of new ideas and projects to pursue.  The packaging and DVD quality are just fine.  No complaints.  Delivery was excellent and delivered on time!
 George Pal directed this classic from 1960, starring Rod Taylor as the scientist who travels back through time (George, although we are meant to understand that this is a character-cipher for H.G. Wells), and Yvette Mimieux in a very early role (interestingly, she became an anthropologist, the study of which has a concern in the overall plot development and socio-political points Wells was trying to drive home with his novel).  The plot follows Wells' late Victorian novel fairly well.  Scientist George invents a time machine, and after making the proclamation to several of his nay-saying friends, including a test with a miniature time machine, takes off on a few journeys.  The early journeys are just to test, and we see a few fascinating effects here.  But the greater story lies in George's hope for the future, so he sets himself to go nearly a million years in to the future - the year 802701.  Trivia buffs will recognise the date on the machine as October 12, the same date Columbus discovered the new world.  George embarks into this new world, finding the human race has evolved into a split species - the above-ground Eloi, and the below-ground Morlochs.  The Eloi are carefree airheads for the most part - that is, until the Morlochs threaten, and then they become the hunted.  The Morlochs are presented as base creatures, following only their appetites, and afraid to remain above for too long.  The effects of the time machine itself and the transition scenes are quite good for the time - I recall as a child watching this film on television and being mesmerised by the passage of time, the scenery changes through George's window as the time streamed by, and the contrast between the Victorian household set and the future world.  The more recent remake did homage to this classic film by incorporating a few of the same ideas - the scene changes through the windows, for example.  Also, Alan Young (who played Filby in the 1960 film) appeared in the more recent film, the only actor to appear in both.  George has a tough decision to make - his time machine is stolen by the Morlochs; does he risk his life to get it back?  And does he opt to stay in the future or go back to his own time if he recovers it?  Only time will tell.
 I was glad to find this version still available.  I enjoyed this because with our technology expanding so rapidly in today's world, time travel appears to not only be possible but probable; maybe in another 100 years.  I wish it were possible now.  This version is truer to the book than the newer version recently produced.  What would you take with you into the future?
 This first cinematographic version of Well's "The Time Machine is unforgettable.  It is quite amazing such impact as the director wasn't a sci-fi movies expert, no great stars were in the cast and no big budget was at disposition.  Even thou director George Pal show an exceptional ability to tell Well's story, with a quick rhythm and a solid cinematographic language.  Rod Taylor as George the Time Traveler, acts convincingly (it is not a stone faced performance as he delivered in "The Birds"). In this movie he is able to transmit to the viewer all the agonies and joys of his character.  A very young Yvette Mimieux fleshes the na�e and adorable Weena (at that time all we youngsters fall in love with her).  Morlocks with their flashing eyes were shocking and were good stuff for "monsters".  The Machine showed in the film has a fascinating "end of XIXth century look and the way it works is believable.  The story is well known but still here it is in a nutshell
 This is truly one of the greatest sci-fi flicks of all time!!!It was my favorite as a child ( though it scared the heck out of me the first time I saw it!) and it is still one of my favorites as an adult.Why? Because we're talking about controlling time itself. The "Ultimate Fantasy"!! This premise alone makes it very fascinating.   Rod Taylor plays H.G.Wells himself, truly the ultimate warrior, that travels 800,000 years into the future! Think about that for awhile. WOW! Co- starring the stunning Yvette Mimieux,Sebastian Cabot,Whit Bissel (of course!), Alan Young ( Mr. ED Fame), directed by George Pal ( The best!)Great cast,great music score, great cinematography,great special effects.( received an Academy Award 1960)  WARNING!!! DO NOT ACCEPT ANY REMAKES OF ANY KIND!! THEY ARE INFERIOR REPRODUCTIONS! This one is the goods!! Morlocks anyone??
 I am no movie critic, just as no one else who writes their own user reviews on this site is but in many ways, we are more important than the world-reknowned movie  experts . While the Ebert's and Roeper's are constantly invited to big premiere's and likely never lay out one single dime to view a movie, it is us; the paying customers, whose dimes make or break a film. That being said, I have put my foot in my mouth in the past when discussing certain actors. Up til now, I've always felt Tom Cruise to be overrated and nothing more than eye candy for starstruck females. As a mere movie fan, I feel as if every actor who achieves greatness has their definitive film that catches my attention and convinces me that they are more than I bargained for. Robert Deniro had  Raging Bull . Ray Liotta had  Goodfellas . Johnny Depp had  Donnie Brasco . Denzel Washington had  Malcolm X . Now, after years of consistently maintaining that Tom Cruise had no more acting talent than a dead carp,  The Last Samurai  has fully inserted foot into my mouth. Actually, I should take a small step back. Within the past year, I have come to learn that Tom Cruise had personally help finance films that he saw that were running into trouble in the home stretch. When things began to look somewhat grim, Tom Cruise helped get  Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels  and  Narc  into American theaters and as a huge fan of both movies, I felt a need to tip my hat to Mr. Cruise for getting those movies attention that they may not otherwise had received. Like me, Tom Cruise was a fan on movies first and I respect that. However, I had yet to see his acting work turn me fully around.  The Last Samurai  changed that forever. In short, Tom Cruise plays a Civil War Captain who has nightmares of murdering innocent Native Americans in battle. These nightmares feed his obvious drinking problem. He is offered a job for 4 times his regular pay to sail to Japan and train an army to battle the remains of the ancient samurai. Despite their inability to perform, the new Japanese army marches into battle prematurely and amidst a stampede by the samurai, he is captured alive. During his captivity, he meets Katsumoto and through the winter months, he  slowly grows to understand their culture and their respect for life and death. All of this is climaxed in the final battle when he rides out in battle as a samurai with Katsumoto in what ends up being probably the greatest battle scene ever committed to film or at least on par with that of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.  The acting by the entire cast is superb. Tom Cruise's transformation from tragic figure to hardened warrior is nothing short of flawless. The respectful manner in which the samurai is portrayed takes you back into a period in history where you clearly witness a clash of civilizations. One of the finest ways that this is captured is the poetic and ballet-esque motion of the battle sequences. One can tell immediately that the director went to great lengths to avoid having this film be categorized as merely another  samurai flick . It is instead a great, epic film about a culture that was driven into the annals of history and all but forgotten about. The total package includes a supplement disc containing a virtual well of special features that take you on a stunning detailed ride behind the camera with interviews, historical comparisons, costume and set designs and training for battle sequences. A package this superbly concocted is a crime to ignore.
 Dances with wolves meets Shogun, with a little Braveheart thrown in (When you see the final battle scene in the movie, and have already seen Braveheart, you'll see what I mean)....but done real well. (Thank god!) Makes me want to be a samurai just watching it. If you have any interst in Japanese History or culture I highly recomend it.
 Both Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise did an outstanding job in their perfomrances in this movie, though for Watanabe san it was mere rotuine for him since he has regularly played such roles in his native homeland of Japan. His skills as a Samurai in this movie shined brightly and I was also taken by his english speaking capability. Tom Cruise also did a very good job in adapting for this role unlike other movies of his. After seeing other movies of his I was somewhat disappointed by his perfomrances. After purchasing a book about the making of this movie, it explained very well all the details as to what when into the making of this movie from choosing locations, costume design, history of the Samurai and other details. From reading this it not only shows that Tom Cruise put forth countless hours in preparing for this movie as an actor and at the same time displaying respect for the Japanese culture. Special mention undoubtedly goes to both Koyuki and newcomer to me Hiroyuki Sanada. Though I have never seen Hiroyuki san myself while I was in Japan for the last eleven years, his performance fell nothing short of spectacular. As for Koyuki san, most of her roles in Japan have been those of Japanese dramas where she obvioulsy speaks her native tounge. In "The Last Samurai she shows that she is able to gain your undivided attention not only by her beauty, but by her presence even if she does not have many speaking roles. For those who do not understand the Japanese culture much at all, "The Last Samurai can and will shed some light for you in not only understanding but appreciating the culture as well.  I intend not only to view this movie numerous times when I wish to view great perfomrances by these actors, but to also take me back to a country which I fell in love with while I was there.
 I agree with most of the other reviewers. This movie is an excellent, touching, and soon to be classic movie. Tom Cruise is simply Tom Cruise as always. He might not win the Oscar, but who needs Oscar when other actors go for Oscar to become as famous as Tom. The director does a good job, and this is one of the rare movies of 2003 that makes sense unlike Matrix or Terminator sequels. I recommend this one as a resolution for '04!
 Warner Brothers can?t catch a decent break, can they? For the last three years, the studio has had a mixed year based on the performance and public reaction of their films with the missteps outshining the successes. 2003 continues that trend with the poor reception of films like Gods & Generals, Dreamcatcher, Alex & Emma, and Looney Tunes
 Great battle scenes never seen in this scale. Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise was superb.
 I'm gonna review the quality of the blu-ray version of this movie. I'm not gonna review the movie itself as there are enough reviews of it. The image quality is totally HD quality, image is crisp and detailed and the audio is superb. I'm not a fan of special features so I can't tell you if there are enough as I normally don't watch them unless there are deleted scenes or alternate endings. If you like this movie and you have an hdtv then this is a good purchase.
 When should Tom Cruise get an Oscar nomination and wins it ? I'm not a serious Cruise's fan, but I like his work and he works hard for his roles as many A-list actors do. Again, he should be nominated for best actor Oscar for his role in the Last Samurai. It has some of the modern themes of regional and global superpowers dominations and attemp to change the inner cultures of other nations for the sake of self-centered interests and for the love of control. You'll find those elements somtimes hidden within the storytelling. The battle sequences are very well performed yet they need to be longer in duration. The movie is visually stunning. It is a very good movie to watch, and certainly one of the 2003 best movies.
 Okay, first off I want to say that this was a great movie, great acting and directing, great battle scenes and beautiful Japanese scenery. Many people say this is Dances With Wolves, yes the plot is slightly the same, but I watched Dances With Wolves, I have almost never watched such a boring movie, If The Last Samurai is this, it is certainly a much less boring version. And many people complain about how Tom Cruise doesnt die at the end, well 'It was not his time' as Katsumoto explained numerous times in the movie. And the reason the children and Taka fall in love with Tom is that they forgave him for killing their father/husband, they beleived they where both warriors that did their duty on the field, and they certainly believed that their way of life was worth fighting for. I would think that the way of the samurai or Bushido was worth fighting for, especially back then. As Tom said 'What could be more necissary?'
 I feel thsi is a better moive than Lord of the rings the  Return of the king, the best movie i have ever seen. and , The music is fantastic, the acting excelent, i cant wait to watch this movie at home in my  70 inches  widescreen HDTV , and my Home theater...!!!!
 This is, without a doubt, the most underrated movie of 2003. This is Edward Zwick's crowning achievement and would be Tom Cruise's best performance if he hadn't been in "Born on the 4th of July". I enjoyed "Master and Commander but it is so 2nd rate to this. This movie is a beautiful story about a civil war captain, scarred by the way he saw the Native Americans get salughtered by his fellow troops, who is brought by fate to these very spiritual people (the samurai), who learn him their customs and heal his psychological wounds. When his old American comrades come to bring down the samurai, he does all he can to defend them.It is similar to "Dances with Wolves and "Lawrence of Arabia in that it is about a depressed man who changes his ways. But I think that this movie is ultimately superior to them. (Another thing, the art and costume design in this movie are breathtaking, another reason to see this movie). This movie deserved the 10 oscar nominations "Master & Commander recieved (including best picture).
 For those who have always believed in being a Samurai, or trying to relive their days in the era that Samurai roamed, the movie in a way gave people that perspective. Of course, it's through the eyes of an American, because as we know it, Americans can't always see things clearly, only through hardships and experience of other people's culture can they truly come to know the differences and traditions of other nationalities. To me, I personally liked the movie for many reasons, the soundtrack was one of the many things, but it was the drama put into the story. It's like that old series, "Shogun", about a sailor from the west who was shipwrecked in Japan and brought up to become a Samurai. Stories that involve a learning process and finally understanding the ways of another is what I love to see in my movies, so I really do applaud the movie for what it does.
 The Last Samurai was certainly a surprisingly refreshing escape from the many senseless movies that've recently been released into theatres. The movie was beautifully shot, paying close attention to detail, plus even the acting wasn't as dreadful as I'd expected it to be. To add to everything, the writers even had the sense to put in little sequences of comic relief, whether you found it remotely funny or not...  I thought the casting was fantastically done. It was interesting to see Tom Cruise playing such a role. Though not the best actor in the movie, he certainly did good enough of a job in developing his character throughout the course of the film. Ken Watanabe was excellent as Katsumoto. Also, I found it rather....different...when I found out that the lead actress, Koyuki, was 28 years old! Given the fact that so many "young actresses are casted in movies these days (unless they are the starring role), I just found that fact interesting...  Another good thing about this movie is that the Japanese characters actually speak Japanese to one another (there are subtitles, of course). There are numerous American films out there where peoples of different ethnicities end up speaking English to one another in the films, as opposed to their ethnic languages. This film, however, failed to follow that trend, which in my eyes made the entire atmosphere of the film much more authentic. Instead of the Japanese peoples speaking English to one another, the foreigner is forced to learn and adapt to the language of the Japanese instead.  Of course, this movie wasn't always perfectly unscathed. Given that it's an American film, you just had to expect its few "Hollywood moments. It's odd how Tom Cruise is able to defend himself from a gruop of samurais in the opening battle, and later degrades himself to a nobody when he fights against Katsumoto for the first time. Then there are the moments when everyone dies in a scene expect, you guessed it, good ol' Tom Cruise. Oh well, what's a Hollywood movie without these moments?  Overall, I'd highly recomment this movie. Unless you absolutely cannot stand the mere sight or thought of Tom Cruise, I'm quite confident that most audiences will enjoy this movie
 I saw this movie on the 28th of December.  I walked out of the theater very, very, very satisfied with the movie.  The audience was the worst audience I've ever sat through a movie with it.  If the audience is bad, it can ruin the movie, and make you like it half as much.  That's probably why it's only my second favorite movie.  (My favorite being Office Space)  Though this movie is rated R, it really isn't that bad.  There is blood, but no gore.  When someone gets stabbed, naturally, they're going to bleed.  When somone gets shot, naturally, they're going to bleed.  But, they're flesh isn't naturally going to be split apart.  This movie keeps it realistic.  To tell you what it's about
 "The Last Samurai is a breathtaking, historical, panorama that examines the blending of cultures and the clash of competing value systems. In this film, Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren a twelve year old boy who has moved from New Jersey to the California Coast with his single mom. While adjusting to his new environment, Algren practices Bushido (the way of the warrior) from an instruction book and from a few introductory classes that he learned at the local YMCA in his hometown.  He also befriends a local girl who, unfortunately is hounded by her ex-boyfriend, an arrogant and aggressive teenager who cruises around town with his friend on dirt bikes. When the ex-boyfriend catches Algren and the girl together a fight ensues and Algren is beaten and humiliated. This prompts Algren to go to the local Bushido dojo where unfortunately he discovers that the ex-boyfriend is the star pupil and the instructor is a sadist.  Fortunately, Algren meets Mr. Miyagi an old Samurai warrior who works as a handyman in Algren's rental unit. When Mr. Miyagi realizes Algren's dilemma he takes him on as his lone pupil and teaches him the way of Bushido. Mr. Miyagi orders Algren to paint his fence, wax his car, and strike girlie-man poses on a post by the sea shore all the while promising that this will teach him how to wield a Katana like no other Caucasian man has ever done before. And somehow it works. All of Mr. Miyagi's household chores turn out to be magic Samurai conditioning techniques that convert Algren into the Unstoppable White Warrior (UWW). From here an epic battle takes place between Algren and the ex boyfriend and his evil cohorts. I won't give away the outcome of this incredible battle scene except to say that Cruise does a lot of grunting, his eyes puff out during some of the more visceral moments of combat and his beard flutters in the wind like the calm of the butterfly.
 Way better than Lord of the Rings. The battle sequences were suberb and stunning. I loved the fighting and plot. Tom Cruise was awesome in acting in this movie. It was also historicly accurate. So you can learn from this film. It was very educational. It deserves some academy awards. If you like movies like Gladiator you'd pamper yourself by coming to this movie
 After picking up my HD DVD player I've had troubles watching regular DVD movies.  I had heard some good things about this movie but couldn't pass it up once it was in high definition.  The story is pretty good.  This is the story of Captain Algren who has been sent to Japan in the late 1800's in order to help them modernize the Japanese army as they go from fighting with swords and arrows to machine guns and cannons.  After the "modern Japanese army prematurely attacks the Samurai and lose horribly, Captain Algren is taken captive by the Samurai and introduced to their way of life and refusal to lay down the sword in the name of compliance.  In time, Captain Algren finds himself wanting to become one of the Samurai and learning more of their way of life.  The story is pretty good but what raises this up to the level of being outstanding is the high definition quality of the movie.  It was fantastic, especially seeing the colorful Japanese landscape in all of its magnificence.  If you like Tom Cruise action movies, this is one to pick up especially in high definition (whether it be Blu-Ray or HD DVD).  The violence can be extremely graphic (hey, this is war) so if you are sensitive to that you may want to look for something else.  Otherwise, the pacing of the movie is pretty good.  It isn't an all out gore-fest... there is action and then it breaks and lets you relax and catch up a little bit and then goes back to action and so on and so forth.
 Frankly i purchased this item just to know how a BD differ from a DVD on my HDTV using my newly purchased PS3. i chose this product cause it has a lot of natural & colorful scenes. the result was really amazing, visualy, blu-ray movies really surpasses DVD. i couldnt test the audio difference, cuz i only have 5.1 Sony decoder. the movie per say is a must see for all those who like action titles.
 I really enjoyed this movie  Edward Zwick , it was a masterpiece it had it all. Action, suspense, a love story, sympathetic characters. That musical score too man that was almost overwhelming. I really dont understand the criticisms for  the movie, except maybe its the biased, attitude that Americans have because this movie is a hit. Roger Ebert and Roper gave this movie critical acclaim. Its gathered a great rating on IMDB, the movie is beautifully acted, has a good story and has an epic feeling like the movie "Glory".  The movie also was a labor of love by all involved, the costume designs and background were absolute genius, and  even Tom Cruise was one of the producers for the film.  Catching an HBO special on it, you could tell Tom realized  he did something special with this film.  The story is that Tom plays a confederate like soldier ordered  to kill a group of Japanese warriors during the middle 18 century. He encounters and is captured by Katsumot (Ken  Watanabe). However instead of killing Nathan Algren, Katsumoto  keeps him alive so he can get info about the Emperor's men  that are attacking him and the American soldiers.  Algren then during his capture sees both sides of the story,  he realizes that Katsumoto is not the enemy, its the very  people that hired for the job that are the enemy, from  the corrupt officials in Asia who want to turn the country  into a capitalistic state with the salivating Americans  like Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwynn) ready to take advantage.  "The Last Samurai simply stated is an excellent movie, you will  not waste your time watching this movie, its an excellent flick  that deserves your viewing.
 I thought  The Last Samurai,  was an excellent movie.  I plan on keeping this DVD handy.  I have little doubt that I will watch this one many, many times.
 As a Japanese person, I watched this movie with much skepticism. I expected many stereotypes etc. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was an intesting twist how it took a  outsider  to convince the young emperor to make the stand he made at the end. Even Katsumoto wasn't able to do that. I think the emperor was reminded of the Samurai Spirit, ironically by a Westerner. The scene near the end, with the new machine guns from America, depicts with new beginning of modern Japan. It was sad to see how easily the Samurai was defeated. 1 by 1 like bowling pins, these greate warriors went down. It's as though they saved the  best  for last. So to me, those machine guns symbolized the modernization. I thought Katsumoto's character was great but thought Cruise's character was needed to complete the story. The  Seppuku , or suicide, is not an act of cowardice. It is an act of honor. It was considered the honorable way to die. It depicts the deepest dedication of the Samurai. You see this in the modern world today. Maybe not to this type of extreme. Sacrifice oneself for the love of country isn't so far fetched an idea. I think this world could use a little bid of that code of honor...
 Tom Cruise is a famous actor worldwide. Most of you have seen his work in various films, such as A Few Good Men or Jerry Maguire. However, Tom is back in a new movie, which takes the audience back into an era of the past - one that surrounds us in the days of the Civil War. Tom Cruise portrays a man named Nathan Algren, who is a hero during the Civil War, but is disillusioned of the terrible killings he had to perform under the leadership of Colonel Bagloney against the American Indians. He is hired, by the Japanese Emperor, to take down another rebellion by leading a army of Japanese peasants that never saw a gun in their life. Even though he trains them for a time, the rebels attack and Algren is ordered to track them down and defeat the adversary, despite the fact that more training is needed.  Fighting somewhere in the forests of Japan, his army is easily defeated and the rebels capture him and take him back to their village. Becoming a captive and not having a chance to escape, due to the fact that winter's coming, Algren spends his time with these people, already inspired and intrigued. He comes to learn that these people are "Samurai", who serve the Emperor and follow life through a different path and a set of principles that keep their life in balance, using such values as loyalty, duty, and compassion, just to name a few. Only one problem remains - Japan is facing a new modernized world and is seeking to keep up with the times by throwing away the traditions of old in favor of a more-friendly government. The rebellion, lead by a samurai named Katsumoto (portrayed by Ken Watanbe), despies that idea and fight back in order to keep their sacred ways alive. Gaining his sense of honor and redemption back, Algren joins the Samurai and aids them in a fierce battle that decides Japan's history for the rest of time.  The movie does have its dose of action scenes and story moments, but what really make this movie unique are its philosophical moments. The Samurai, as you know, are people that follow the way of the Bushido, the traditional code of the Japanese samurai, stressing honor, self-discipline, bravery, and simple living. It's the type of values that most people wish to live by, but the Samurai go far beyond that. If they are defeated in battle, then it means that they have dishonored themselves and their clan, thus will kill them for disgracing their families and those close to him or her. It's a tough life, to be sure, but it's the principles of their life that stands out. Tom Cruise said it best about the Samurai
 I enjoyed it both times I saw it on the big screen, but for some reason when I bought and watched it tonight it seemed so much better than the previous viewings. The love story is classy and not overdone as in most epics and the acting is wonderful. Tom Cruise delivers his most convincing role to date and this is one of the few parts I actually liked him in (thats saying a lot!). Of course, as mentioned in numerous reviews, Ken Watanabe steals the show as the Samurai leader and should have been awarded the Oscar over Tim Robbins. The action scenes are brutal and hold your interest, (SPOILERS!!!) but I didn't like the fact that Cruise was the only character to survive the final battle. Very unrealistic and is truly the only part that brings the film down a bit. Great cinematography and an excellent soundtrack as well. I must also mention the fact that very little CGI was used in this film and that just makes the battles and actual locations that much more believable. Don't waste money renting a movie you'll want to buy the next day. Add it to your collection to watch again and again!
 Amazing! The movie really brought out the true beauty of Japanese culture and history, as well as the violence and conflicts. During the movie one just sits there, awed in silence, feeling sadness and tragedy as one witnesses the demise and end of an ancient tradition and lifestyle, bushido (way of the warrior). My older sister, a well-known artist, couldn't stop commenting on the exquisite acting of Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada,etc. I recommend this movie to people to have an interest in the Orient and its history and to anyone who enjoys a movie with a touching story, rich in sentiment and that evokes emotion. Bless you all, thank you!
 The story is about a man haunted by his past in being part of a massacre of an Indian tribe. He can't sleep quietly since he is punished by nightmares about how he was forced to be and participate in something he clearly saw as wrong but had no other choice. Simply put this character is another poor life destroyed by war. He is hired by the Japanese to train the Imperial Army in the occidental ways at a time a week emperor allows his advisors to forget tradition an import the ways of "more advanced civilizations". In the process, the man gets captured by the samurai and during this captivity he begins not only to learn about their ways and philosophy, but also has peace for the first time in many years.  The Costume Design is incredibly accurate and the cinematography is absolutely superb. The music by Hans Zimmer is just beautiful, like another Gladiator epic. This movie is for people who love those little details. The production is really ambitious and works to deliver an astonishing view. This DVD is really promising with features like the "History vs. Hollywood
 You may think I am joking but Honestly, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I have found so many movies so boring of late that I just doze off during the performance. This movie tells a good story with well paced action scenes. Beautifully photographed and with a very nice music score throughout.
 Beautifully filmed with a plot that truly touches the heart. The cast chosen were oerfect and the theme was good. No regrets! Wating for the DVD to be released. A sure buy thing. I wanted to go watch it the 3rd time.
 Last Samurai is one of my all time favorite movies. It's often compared with "Dances With Wolves set in Japan, and indeed the plots are somewhat similar
 This movie is a thing of beauty, with the substance to match its style. A stunning spectacle of cultural violence and a loving tribute to the great Japanese samurai.
 The Last Samurai
 I was very impressed with this movie. More so for the costuming and scenery than the acting. Although the characters were very good and the actors chosen to play the roles did fine jobs. As a semi-historical film, it glossed over many of the international politics that affected Japan in that era. But it did a fine job of depicting one result of those politics. Samurai of the "old school saw their way of life slipping away, and being replaced by a style of warfare they felt was dishonorable. They also feared more foreign intervention in the coming years, and saw a gradual eroding of their Emporer's power.  This is one of the few Tom Cruise movies that I felt he didn't try to carry the whole film. It achieved a fairly good balance of allowing the characters to all enjoy an importance in the film that made it more informative and enjoyable to watch.  I was impressed with this film, and highly recommend it.
 I'm really not one to write movie reviews, I enjoy them for what they are and don't usually care enough to actually publish something about them.  However, for this film I will make an exception.  First off, gorgeous scenary.  There is a scene with Tom Cruise practicing a sword kata with the sun setting in the background ... it's beautiful.  There are many wonderful scenes in the movie.  Secondly, the plot is about transformation and self forgiveness.  I don't care if it's been "done before", this is a common archetype in all cultures and times and it is well portrayed through this film.  I find it well done, quite emotionally gripping at times.  The action in this film is great, Star Wars eat your heart out.  I grew up in a traditional martial art family, and Tom Cruise did a very solid job with the sword play in this movie.  The star wars films drove me nuts, but maybe you don't need proper body mechanics when you have "the force".  Anyways, good work in the martial arena as well in this film.  Finally, I saw this film three times in theatres and everytime people cried.  Seriously.  Everytime the end came around at least one person both men & women cried.  Very well done film.
 The Last Samurai is a great movie, good story, very entertaining.  I'd recommend seeing this movie as soon as it comes out on DVD if you haven't seen it yet. This movie is not a study in phenomenology and existential philosophy, but a good movie that made tears come to my eyes and that doesn't happen too often. I thought this movie was better than the Lord of the Rings, though I'd guess that that comes from actually reading the books.
 I'm actually surprised how anyone can bash this film, although when I came to this review section I quickly understood why. The bashers
 This film is a must see!!!  Tom reaches deep down for the emotions expressed in this film.  You feel every ounce of his anguish and regret for the terrible things he's done in his war days. I agree with the critics (something I rearely do...) when they say this film is of epic porportions.....  This film moved me very deeply, but it also had a touch of humor here and there..just enough. I can't wait until it's released so I can see it again!!!!
 This movie is one of my favorites very entertaining. I wanted a personal copy so that I could turn on the subtitles and be able to follow along during the Japanese dialog.
 This movie is amazing.  I have it on DVD, but the Blue-Ray is so much better.  All the action scenes look so real, almost like you are there.  Highly recommend.
 The Last Samurai is an outstanding film that tells the fictional story of Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise), a soldier haunted by regrets hired to train raw Japanese recruits to fight the Samurai, and Samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe), who is leading a rebellion in Japan against those who he believes are westernizing the country too quickly. Algren ends up becoming a prisoner of the Samurai, but after spending a number of months as their captive, subsequently finds peace in their way of life. Eventually, he joins forces with the men he was hired to fight against.  Not only is the plot interesting and original, but the performances of the actors are nothing short of amazing. Tom Cruise puts forth an outstanding effort, which I consider his best ever. Ken Watanabe is perfect as Katsumoto, commanding even more attention than Cruise, and all of the secondary characters are equally convincing in their roles. Some of the highlights include Koyuki as Taka, Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, and Timothy Spall as Simon Graham.  The execution of the battle scenes was excellent. This can be attributed to a cast full of professional sword-fighters as extras and Cruise and Watanabe doing all their own stunts. As seen in the extras, the progression of Cruise's skills with a sword isn't staged, either. Sanada and others spent hours working with him every day until he could handle a blade with precision.  Having seen this film a dozen times, I can also say I honestly am not able to find many mistakes in the filming and editing, either. The ones I have noticed are hidden well, and none of them take away from the film in any way. There are a few lines in the script that come across as slightly bland or predictable, but overall the script is very well written. Tom Cruise actually speaks Japanese in a handful of scenes, and he does it well.  What really makes the movie, on top of everything else, is the beautiful score composed by Hans Zimmer. Though he often recycles his scores and changes them very little, this one is unique and powerful.  The Last Samurai's historical accuracy isn't as poor as some reviewers would suggest, but it is a work of fiction. On the special edition of this DVD, 2 deleted scenes are included, along with "the filming of one of the scenes, and "the filming of the Cruise beheading scene. There is also a handful of interviews and a look at the real history of the decline of the Samurai in Japan.  All in all, The Last Samurai is an extremely entertaining and convincing film. The special edition of this DVD is well worth the extra few dollars, and it has become one of my all time favorite movies.
 When I watch a movie that I enjoy, I'll watch it many times with months in between to allow it to breath. If I can find more depth and meaning each time, I consider it more than just a film, it becomes a teaching about life. Such is my finding for this exceptional movie. It offers up a wide variety of important, even vital, lessons of life portrayed to perfection by everyone involved. The writing, directing, acting, locations, depth of meaning are all most excellent! In today's world we often race by the more subtle and beautiful aspects of life. A movie such as this calls forth pause and consideration of what is being served up for our enlightenment as well as our enrichment. The Last Samurai is about the redemption of humanity as well as the individual- the awakening to a deeper level of life, honor, purpose, self sacrifice, and pure, love. While watching this film for perhaps the 7th time, I fully realized that it is a true masterpiece. I suggest to the viewer, that they treat this film as one would a rare and fine wine. The point is to take your time with this film, sipping it slowly and savoring every drop of it's wonderful bouquet of thoughts and emotions, and in the end become enriched by an understanding what films have the potential of delivering and sadly also, what they seldom do and that is a fuller appreciation of "life in every breath. I had no interest in seeing THE LAST SAMURAI when it was in theaters.  Then recently I caught a portion of the movie on a cable channel and knew immediately I had to have the DVD.  Since I got it, I have watched it 3 or 4 times.  I am totally in awe of the acting performances in THE LAST SAMURAI.  While I have never been a Tom Cruise fan (the publicity about him does not sway me one way or the other), this movie has given me a great appreciation of his talent.  It made me also realize what a tremendous amount of preparation work and physical training it takes for an actor to develop the skills for his roll.  Other performances in the movie were exceptional, especially that of Ken Watanabe.  If you have never seen THE LAST SAMURAI, don't have a clue what it is all about, or don't think its subject matter would interest you, take a chance.  If you don't want to buy it (the price is right), rent it.  After you have seen it, you will want to own it.  Don't like Tom Cruise?  Don't let that stop you.  My husband doesn't like him, yet he loved this movie.  His remark
 My favorite element of this movie is Tom Cruise as modern man finding Solace in the ancient ways of Japan.  It is a powerful analogy which explores what it means to be succesful in society and what it means to be a modern man.  Something I often wonder about while thinking of my legacy.
 I so wanted to hate this film, the whole Hollywood schtick of white people coming in to rescue poor savages sickens me. Therefore I avoided it, every single time it came on cable I would change the channel scoffing at its very existence. Then with a bout of insomnia I stayed up late and caught the first half...I was hooked there after. I enjoyed the development of the relationship between Mr Cruise and Mr Watanabe's characters and by far Mr Watanabe was the better actor, a shame that his skill was not recognized. It is a story of growth and acceptance in the face of overwhelming odds. I found myself moved, although there were strains of "Dancing with Wolves I was intrigued enough by the story to overlook it.
 This epic film has to be one of Tom Cruise's best efforts. The story is not about war, instead it is about the culture, spirit and way of the Samurai. It was such a disappointment that this film did not get the recognition it deserved. Ken Watanabe's performance was simply outstanding. Tom Cruise put his heart and soul into this film. He is such a powerful actor!
 Terrific action-packed movie.  No dull moments here.  Tom Cruise plays a misplaced American soldier hired to help transform Japan's feudal military into a modern Western one.  In the process he is captured in battle and exposed to the samurai way of life which he ultimately embraces.  An intriguing look into this arcane culture.  Director Edward Zwick's cinematic direction and Hans Zimmer's scoring makes "The Last Samurai appealing on so many different levels.  But it's Ken Watanabe's razor-sharp performance and Koyuki's stunning elegance that steal the show.  A definite 5-star entertainment film.
 Don&#8217;t have to say much here. This is an action film in the no-tongue-in-check, classic sense, of films like &#8220;In the Line of Fire,&#8221; &#8220;Rob Roy,&#8221; and so on, a true action film. Absolutely worth watching and owning. It is one of Cruise&#8217;s best performances. I just wish there were more films like this. Empowering.  -- Michael Erlewine, Founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)
 I have never been a Tom Cruise fan.....until now! The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it is by far Tom Cruise's best role. Also adding to the film's greatness is the performance by KEN WATANABE as Katsumoto.  He is an incredible actor!!!  To put it simply.....you do not want this film to end.  It is one that you will want to watch over and over again.
 Of late, I have found a lot of Cruise movies to be little more than crap on a stick. And when I saw the commercials when this movie came out in the movies, I couldnt help but laugh. However after reading a bunch of good reviews, I decided to go see it. I was honestly blown away. It is a solid epic movie, which can drawn comparison to the blockbuster Gladiator (another of my favorites).   This is a movie based solely around the notion of ideals. And the unique storytelling is what makes it an epic-type. Of course there is the great battle and everything that leads up to it will either make you love the movie or just utterly hate it. But what i found best served the movie was the fact that it didnt try to add any torrid romance to it. Thank goodness Zwick understood that making a movie about the morals of the Samurai and adding a couple extra sex scenes wouldnt work.   Basically, if you like  epic  movies like Gladiator, this is a great movie for you to watch.
 This is a movie that is great and which exceeds beyond movie limits. It has action, a great plot, and great actors. 10 stars for this movie!
 Now this is what I like.Courage...Honor...respect...Fighting for a cause not just some measly paycheck that is not worth the soul it is printed on. Real values. It is ashame that Honor is not taken more seriously by anyone other than old Japanese warriors. Because It is the only thing that defines a man, not his purse.
 This movie, was incredible, simply put.  Such a mix of romance and honor, all beautifully blended together.  Tom Cruise does a WONDERFUL job in this film, playing a troubled man who took part in killing innocent indian tribes, who takes a job in Japan training japanese soldiers who would be trained to supress rebel forces led by Samurai Katsumoto, who believed that Japan was progressing into modern culturization too fast, and resisted political advisors that were urging the Emperor to do just that, become more western, and modern.  Katsumoto's tribe of Samurai defeat the  unit led by Capt Algren (Cruise) and capture him.  He is held in captivity with the Samurai, and thrives off the peace that is afforded him there.  He begins dwell in the same way he observes the people do in the village, and learns honor with the help of Katsumoto.  In the battle preceding his capture, Algren kills Samurai Horutoru,  Katsumoto's brother in law, and his caretaker Kata's husband.  During his time in this village, Kata is repulsed by Algren, troubled with the death of her husband.  As cruise learns the ways of these people, and japanese, he gives his formal apology to Kata, who surprises him by replying that he did his duty, and so did her husband, and that the apology was accepted.  As his status as a 'stray dog' is gently brushed aside, he gradually becomes accepted.  When an assassin team of ninja attempt to kill Katsumoto, he refutes his american heritage and helps keep Katsumoto alive.  In the end, as a desperate attempt at saving the village in which Katsumoto's ancestors had worked so hard to build and protecet, Katsumoto and Algren lead an army of Samurai warriors against the rebuilt japanese army.  Witnessing this scene was so sad.  A doomed attempt.  Since Samurai refuse to bear firearms, they were vastly at a disadvantage, against the cannons and the new automatic turrets.  As a final test of honor, the remaining samurai charge the army, only to be vicously mowed down in the heat of battle.  In a final touching moment,  Algren and Katsumoto, wounded, Katsumoto perhaps fatally, contemplate Katsumoto's suicide in honor, only to end in the deed being done and Algren witnessing the utmost peace in death in honor.  He Presents Katsumoto's sword to the emperor,  who realizes that he had been wrong to let his 'advisors' lead him around too much, and that it was wrong to forget his honor. A simply AWE inspiring film, a must see, for anyone.
 I was very impressed by this film. The characters portrayed much emotion and realism. The ending was quite emotional too. This is one of the rare films that the would be bad guys are actually good. I was very touched. The extras on the second disc were pretty good, I liked the history of the film and the era which it takes place. I rented, I saw, I bought. Enough said. MF
 While it may not be historically accurate and exact does anyone know of any film created in Hollywood that is?  I mean come on folks, it's Hollywood.  And I love Hollywood because mostly it's all entertaining.  The Last Samurai is entertaining and somewhat historically accurate, but the best thing about this movie to me is the underlying message.  The one about Honor.  Duty.  Bushido and the Samurai way.  If you've ever wondered about the Samurai or heard about them but didn't quite  get it , watch this movie.  Then you will  get it .  The mind, the culture, the beauty of the Japanese(Samurai) mind.  I saw this movie the same week that I saw the 3rd Lord of the Rings, and my first comment upon leaving the theater was,  Wow that was 10 times better than the Lord of the Rings .  For me it was and it is.  Enjoy.
 Let me just say that this movie could have so easily been a horrible romance flick.  They could have had trashy love scenes and cheesy personal moments. I believe that they handled the material and relationships between actors WONDERFULLY. Additionally, this movie had quite a few accurate historical moments and weapons. I highly recommend this flick.
 As a Japanese living in the United Staes, I can say totally, that this film is amazing. There're some critics says Tom Cruise's acting and so on, however, this film sucessfully depicts the history of Japan, and people's traditional lives and the end of samurai era.  This is a spectacular movie with sweeping sword actions and it is based on the true history events in japan, I've seen a lot of samurai movies(made in japan for japanese) but i can say this one is GREAT as the other movies, plus this is not usual hollywood movies that  awfully depicts samurais and even Yakuzas and brush off the truth.   I can say, however, without Tom Cruise, this movie could have also been great as well. But i would guess that it is because of him, this movie gained more attention among people and so typical americans can get the idea of what samurai really is and what they really think.  so overall i gave this movie 5 stars. I plan to go watch it again.
 It's 1876. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Japan in order to help the Imperial Japanese Army become more 'modern' and less 'traditional' and ultimately prepare them to fight the legendary Samurai. Events occur that cause Tom Cruise to be a captive of the deadly but extremely polite Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) who is the leader of the Japanese Samurai. At this point, the viewer begins to learn why the Samurai are fighting to preserve their way of life against Western influences and Cruise's character becomes emotionally bound to them and he integrates himself into their society after working hard to earn their trust. However, the film is not solely about the struggle for the Samurai to keep their way of life, another subplot includes the low key and shy love relationship between Algren and Taka, a quiet widow (played with subtlety by Koyuki). Though it isn't a big part in the film, it highlights the emotional aspect of the film and shows that this is not a film about swords.  Positive Points
 A civil war Captain travels to Japan to help them train (using guns and bullets) to fight Samurai Warriors so that the Emperor can bring the western civilization to their country. Tha Samurai think the Emperor does not want this, so act to fight anyone that makes any changes to their country. What happens next is amazing and extremely truthful to ones eye. There is so much more to this movie, especially with the great acting and action and what not, that it turns out to be a MUST SEE motion picture, and I mean ASAP.  This picture will win awards easily. A great motion picture!
 I did not consider myself as a Tom Cruise fan, that is until I bought this DVD and sat through it three times in two days. There is a terrific sound track that compliments the phenomenal camera work and first class acting by all the cast. The battle scenes and the fights are so good I found them spell binding. Special effects were brilliant. The suppressed emotion between Algren and Taka which turns from hate to love was beautifully done. When the Samurai hero dies he says  Perfect . A suitable label for this production. I thoroughly reccommend it.
 THE LAST SAMURAI is for many of us a Sleeper of a movie.  The media mania was so high at the release time in the theaters that it seemed by the trailers that this was another massively expensive Epic riding on the Big Name Star vehicle.  Sadly, I avoided seeing this beautiful film on the big screen
 I love Drama/Epic movies, but The Last Samurai blew me away. It is the best movie in a couple of years. I loved the Acting, Cast and of course the whole place where it was shot.  The settings were beautiful.  I recommend this movie to everyone, awesome movie. I would give it 10 stars if there would be 10 stars. The only movie I can compare this to is Braveheart, but even that one didn't move me as much as The Last Samurai. Buy it now and never get rid of it!!
 FROM START TO FINISH, MR. ZWICK'S ENORMOUSLY BRILLIANT UNDERTAKING OF AN EPIC AND INSTANT CLASSIC, UNFOLDS IN SUCH SEAMLESS, BEAUTIFUL FASHION, THE 2 1/2 HOURS RUNNING TIME SEEMS ALL TO SHORT!  TOM CRUISE, KEN WATANABE, TONY GOLDWYN, AND ALL THE GREAT CAST PLAY THEIE PARTS WITH SUCH EASE AS WELL AS BRILLIANCE, THAT EXCEPT FOR LORD OF THE RINGS RETURN OF THE KING, THIS FILM WOULD/SHOULD IN FACT WALKED AWAY WITH THE OSCARS! THE FINAL, SPECTACULAR BATTLE SEQUENCE IS AMONGST THE FINEST EVER FILMED-DEEPLY MOVING AND HEROIC AS WELL. THE DVD TRANSFER IS MAGNIFICENT AS IS THE AUDIO-1 COMPLAINT THOUGH-WARNER BROTHERS DVD GET WITH THE PROGRAM ALREADY, OK??  WHY NO DTS ON ONE OF YOUR MOST PRESTIGIOUS FILMS OF THE YEAR?  CMON, WB I EXPECT MORE FROM WB PROBABLY THAN ANY OTHER COMPANY OUT THERE BUT THEY ARE TRULY BEHIND IN AUDIO AS FAR AS USING THE DTS FORMAT!  THAT'S MY ONLY COMPLAINT WITH AN OTHERWISE MAGNIFICENT DVD OF A REMARKABLE FILM.  DISC 2 IS JAMMED PACK WITH SO MANY GOOD EXTRAS, I'VE NOT HAD THE TIME TO VIEW ALL OF IT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE MOVIE OVER AND OVER!  BRAVOS TO ALL INVOLVED.
 The modern landscape of hollywood can leave many of us quite depressed with a great void within us. We yearn for movies of subtance. Movies that have some soul... movies that make you think and feel, all while keeping you entertained. The effects laden, poorly scripted, commericial marketing schemes that pass as movies these days leave me for one wondering what happeend to the days when movie making was an art and not a franchise. But then, just as all hope seems lost along comes a movie like this to renew my faith in hollywood's abillity to put together a masterpiece. The Last Sammuri takes place in the late 19th century, as america is in the end of the Indian wars (just after Custer's defeat at little big horn). At this time Japan is a nation undergoing remarkable change. The new Emperor has begun to modernize the formerly feudal nation at lightning speeds. Thus the stage is set in this oriental land for war between the old ways and the new ways. A rebellion of Sammuri warriors, who reject many of the new western ways has begun. The Japanese are at this time seeking advisors from all over the world to aid in thier modernization, including seeking military advisors from america to help train, update and lead the imperial army. An American Captain (Tom Cruise), a veteran of the indian wars, is hired towards this end - much thanks to the fact that he has experience fighting tribal leaders (the movie draws on the similarities between the sammuri and native american warriors). But Tom Cruise gets captured in the first encounter with the sammuri, and after living amongst these amazing people and learning thier ways, finds his own salvation in thier cause.  The plot isn't very complicated, but is rich in historical context and philisophical themes. All the charcters in the movies are very well done, and the acting in this film with only a few minor exceptions was absolutley fantastic (especially the portrayal of Katsomoto, which was just a brilliant performance). The last sammuri has a little of everything. This is a movie that you will feel. You'll laugh, you'll be inspired, you'll be anxious, and you may even get a little watery eyed at some of the more tender moment. There's martial arts, humor, sword fighting, ninjas, battles, love, philosophy, drama - you name it. The movie has some great action sequences and battle scenes but these are not over-done - there is much more. The movie feels almost poetic at times, and the cinematogrophy is beautifully done. Many gorgeous shots are in the movie. And, unlike many movies, the slower scenes don't leave you yawning but are very well done.The music and audio too, was top notch, some of the best I've seen in a while. all in all this became one of my all time favorite movies the moment I saw it. Many of the ellements reminded me of a slightly less gritty version of brave heart. And while Im not sure about the historical accuracy of the plot, the film does an AMAZING job depicting the beauty of japanese culture and the fascinating ways of the sammuri. Context-wise, the film hit it right oin the nose in terms of accuracy and really got it's points across all while being very entertaining. And while some people may feel it a bit slow-paced, I found every last moment of the last sammuri to be a pleasure.  I wouldnt hesitate to call this a masterpiece and the best film of the year.
 I know it appears like Western culture is selfish and materialistic in comparison to the Eastern Asian experience. But, to be bold, I declare that it is so in the context of the time and place. There is good and ill in every social framework, and unlike a Costner film that shall remain unnamed, Samurai doesn't preach such a dogma.  Instead, the film lifts you above it, and illustrates a fundamental truth of the human condition. It does not blunt us over by our shortsightedness; it enlightens us with the truth, and reminds us that we are susceptible to succumbing to inner demons of wealth, power, and accumulation. What matters most are not the tangible treasures that surround us, but the inner intangible treasures that define us. Our pleasure, our pain, our trials and struggles. Our victories...and our monumental failures. They establish who we are, and how we lived, and if at least one person remembers that, then we shall find life again.  Perhaps, in some small way, that's what this movie has done. While not entirely historically correct, and not without it's grandiose notions of good and evil evident in a traditional epic of scope, what The Last Samurai does is remind us of that greater truth, the greater potential inside each and every one of us. Like the blossoms of the peach tree, they ultimately fall, but are born again in each subsequent generation that remembers and chooses to follow a similar path. And, if one looks carefully enough as the light fades in Autumn, one will see that each and every petal is indeed "perfect. As a man who loves Kurawowa and other films of this genre, when I saw Tom Cruise was making this, I thought, "You have got to be kidding....... Then I saw parts of his Oprah stint and said, "Plllleeeease. Once again I underestimated Tom.  Sorry about that TC.   The film was magnificent.  I would have to say it is Oscar worthy, but those dumbasses who do the judging do not know anything about foreign films.  Crouching Tiger deserved best pic darn it!!!!  I cannot believe The Last Samurai was not nominated for best picture.
 An American Civil War "hero is asked to travel to Japan in order to help the Emperor fight against the rebellion of the legendary Samurai, protectors of the country for centuries. When captured by the enemy, the American is asked to stick around for "conversations with the leader of the samurai, who in turn, teaches the Yank a thing or two about life. The film is brilliant in that way because it allows us to connect our own tainted dreams, hopes and ambitions to Cruise's journey through the higher mindedness of the Samurai. talk about an amazing transformation and outlook on life. I always believed that much of that Zen stuff was just plain double-talk, but this film is amazing in both its depth of character interaction and preciseness of dialogue, through which great thought and resonance is placed upon every scene, every word and every action sequence. To that end, consider how almost every person who perished in this film affected me emotionally, during even its most violent scenarios. It's also to note that if actor Ken Watanabe, playing the all-powerful Katsumoto, doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for his part in this film, consider me to be the uncle of a monkey. And did I mention the film's intense and pointed musical score? Yup, Hans Zimmer is back with yet another perfect addition to the film's many strengths and a rousing score that was still buzzing in my head as I washed away the tears of the characters gone by. And before I forgot about one of the film's greatest attributes, consider its all-out sword-fighting, arrow-flinging all of which rival any other action scene from any film this year (which is saying quite a bit) and are pretty gosh-darn brutal to boot. And did you know that the film has ninjas too? Hand to God! In fact, the ninja/samurai head-to-head is about as bloody and furious as they get. Loved it all. Phew. But there's more,
 SPOILERS INCLUDED  THE LAST SAMURAI is one of the best efforts of Tom Cruise's uneven and strange career. Very loosely based on actual events, THE LAST SAMURAI recounts the story of the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, when the Samurai forced the last stand of traditional Japanese culture against the the modernizing influences of the Meiji Restoration.  As part of his drive to bring Japan into the family of nations the Meiji Emperor hired literal armies of foreign advisors. In the film Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a survivor of Gettysburg who later served under Custer and fought Indians on the frontier. The brutalities he has seen have rendered Captain Algren a nightmare-ridden and viciously cynical drunkard. Recruited to go to Japan and train the modern Japanese Army by his despised former superior, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), Algren at first adopts the endemic sneering attitude toward the Samurai shared by the "modernizers". However, the more he hears of the Samurai, the more respect Algren begins to accord them, much to the disgust of his fellows.  When his green army is forced into a premature engagement with the Samurai, Algren is captured and held prisoner by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is the true star of this film. His powerful but understated performance is electric, and Katsumoto's character expresses the best of the Bushido Code and of Japanese tradition. As Algren observes his enemies (and they observe him), hatred mellows into distrust, distrust mellows into acquiescence, acquiescence mellows into acceptance, acceptance becomes respect, and respect becomes liking, and then true friendship. Algren, the professional soldier, comes to see the Bushido Code and the disciplined lifestyle of his captors as the highest expression of his own art---the Art of War. When battle comes, Algren casts his lot with the Samurai.  Although given a safe passage to Tokyo, Katsumoto is unable to sway the young and timid Meiji Emperor, his former student, who is as much a prisoner of the "modernizers as Algren had been of the Samurai traditionalists. Hostilities flare again when Omura (Masato Harada) the chief of the "modernizers tries to have Katsumoto assassinated. The Samurai withdraw into the mountains and prepare for the final battle. When it comes, the Samurai nearly overwhelm their opponents, but armed with cannons and gatling guns, the modern army is insurmountable. In the end, only Algren survives to bring Katsumoto's sword to the Emperor. Although Algren is spat upon by Omura, the Meiji Emperor is so moved by Katsumoto's reverence for the old ways that he orders Omura to commit seppuku. In the end, the cowardly Omura merely exiles himself.  THE LAST SAMURAI had only a lukewarm reception in the United States. Some reviewers felt that the character of Captain Algren was of the "White Man's Burden ilk, that the film was disrespectful of the American historical experience, and that the Samurai were overidealized. Much of this can be put down to a festering dislike of Cruise in the wake of his divorce from Nicole Kidman. However, the film was wildly successful in Japan, and many moviegoers left the theaters in tears, moved by the powerful depiction of traditional Japanese values in the character of Katsumoto and his fellow Samurai. While it is true that much of the Bushido Code was vastly oversimplified in the telling, the essence of Samurai values permeates the film, which, after all, is a form of entertainment, not a philosophical discussion.  The "Extras disc is an "Extras disc. Once a pastiche of fascinating folderol, "Extras discs have degenerated into a predictable melange of "The Making Of...", pointless commentaries, and deleted scenes we wish had stayed deleted. This one isn't much different, though it does have a nice "Hollywood vs. History segment that discusses the real samurai, in truth largely a repressive and regressive elite that had outlived themselves in the 19th century. What might have been very interesting would have been a discussion of how the Bushido Code was institutionally perverted into racist militarism in the first half of the 20th century. The segment barely touches on that subject.  A vast and sweeping epic in the vein of <a href="http
 You already have the story line, so I won't repeat that.  This film shows Cruise's maturation as a SERIOUS actor - finally!!  The other performances are also fantastic; the actors are obviously all serious, veteran actors. (They should have an Academy Award for "Best Casting"; and this film should have won it.)  The film is often graphic (e.g., the final battle scene); but at other times extremely delicate, subtle and sublime (e.g., Cruise's scenes with the wife and children of the man whom he killed in battle). Often not a word is said - but the eyes, body movements, and lighting speak to us in soft tones.  The Japanese actress KOYUKI (who plays "Taka", widow of the warrior Cruise kills in battle near the beginning) is BOTH fantastically beautiful and a most subtle and superb actor.  (Koyuki makes Sophie Marceau and Charlize Theron pale by comparison.)  This movie is a MUST!
 I bought the DVD when it came out, but didn't watch it 'til about a week ago.  I get the feeling it's going to be one I'll return to rather frequently.  The acting, for the most part, is first rate.  I seemed to me that the story is as much about philosophy as it is about action/history.  One can see the power of one's heritage being overrun simply because something is 'inevitable'.  We can, of course, apply that to our own society in many ways.  As I was sitting and watching, I was amazed at just how much I was enjoying the movie on several levels.  Highest rating from me.
 Wow!! In his opening scene, when Tom Cruise fires his Winchester above the heads of the assembled host, he's shooting a "Rifleman's Special.  I suspect that only those who grew up watching Chuck Connors will see it, but there it is.  A beautiful thing to behold.  Meanwhile (speaking of beholding....), this is a first class movie.  One of the all too rare "blockbusters that transcends the cliche.  The movie quite sensitively depicts both the clash of East and West and their reconciliation whilst ultimately telling the story of the End of Things, the destruction of a Way of Life.  It is a one of those very rare not-to-be-missed movies.
 I was a bit skeptical before seeing this movie, but with all the rave reviews it was getting, I figured I would give it a try. Certainly, I was glad I did, because it is thus far, my favorite Cruise movie. He does an excellent job at making his character awestruckingly real, which is of course, the result of talented acting. Watanabe also has a breakthrough role, in which he is part of a group of legendary samurai warriors. This movie is a burrito of action, suspense, and drama all rolled up into one. Usually, movies that attempt to blend all these aspects together do a terrible job, but Last Samurai succeeds by a grand scale. Easily among my favorites.
 ...Whose fought for a forgotten word...Honor .   Last samurai's a movie that brings to the western public a point of view very different about the way to live in the ancient Japan, bringing us back the lost proud of honor (with an eastern tonic). But the main message in the movie is not just see how the samurais fought in battelfield, and cut the throats of their enemies, or how the technology crushed the samurais, no this is not the real point or message, the big deal is that we must remember who we are and where we come from. Now if we look around the dressing, make up and efx, we can move into that age in the ancient Japan, and we learn an important message that master Tsu's ever told... Empty and Full,  Empty is your enemy when he decides to attack you and you are waiting for his attack, so your troops are full and their troops are empty of energy . The example of the Demopolis attack made by persians in the old Greece, was very accord with the last battle, when it's explained by Tom Cruise (Nathan Algren) to Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto)and he used the word  million  and 300, drawing to the samurai that
 This movie being categorized as action, pretty much misrepresents what it's about.  Yes, it has action in it (amazing battle scenes), however it's central theme has to deal with honor, the loss of it, and the loss of a way of life in exchange for a more modern society.  On the one hand you have the Japanese civilization in the middle of adopting a more Western style of living, and on the other you have the Samurai, more than willing to die fighting to keep Japanese tradition alive.    Now, some people say the title of this movie refers to Tom Cruise's character, others (including me) say it refers to Watanabe's character, Katsumoto, who loosely represents the real life Saigo Takamori, the real life samurai who was considered the actual  last samurai .  Some reviewers also describe Tom's character, Algren, as the white man who swoops in to save the day.  I say he was simply a bystander caught up in the events of history.  It's not impossible to believe that a white man can get involve with the samurai, since this idea is borrowed from actual history of a westerner who adopts the samurai way of life during the rise of the Shogunate.    No matter who's name is credited first though, it wouldn't be much of a movie without the cast.  With that said, Ken Watanabe, Hiro Sanada, and Koyuki make this movie.  No offense to Tom Cruise since he was impressive in doing all of his own sword work.  However, it is obvious that his character takes a back seat to what is supposedly the secondary plot of the samurai.  Frankly, this isn't Cruise's movie, it simply has Cruise in it.
 I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, but after watching this movie my opinion of him has slowly begin to change.  Granted, Cruise is a good actor, but there are several others I would place ahead of him in terms of acting ability and on camera congeniality.  Nevertheless, I believe The Last Samurai is one of Tom Cruise's best films, if not his best film ever, because he does an outstanding job of portraying the role of Capt. Nathan Algren;  Algren is a Civil War and Indian War veteran who is tortured over the atrocities he has viewed and committed on the front lines.  These experiences have transformed Algren into a man filled with bitterness and cynicism and driven him to embrace alcohol as his escape mechanism from reality.   Cruise does an excellent job of capturing this particular spirit in the film.  Even though Cruise's performance is excellent, the film is only bolstered by the performances by the performances of Watanabe and the rest of the cast.  Watanabe was simply terrific as the Samurai warlord, Katsumoto.  On screen he exuded a kind of gentle but stern warrior aura, and showed he was a man of astute intellectual abilities.  In his performace Watanabe displayed all the qualities and characteristics that were essential to the Samurai.  Besides the performances the battle sequences and costumes were spectacular.  In addition, the scenery and setting were also very good and captured the atmosphere of a 19th century Japan that was experiencing rapid Westernization.  At several instances in the film it is easy to see vestiges of traditional Eastern Japansese culture stand side by side with modern Western culture.  Last but not least, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is phenomenal. As always, Zimmer delivers a rousing an emotional score that complements the film and actually heightens the sensitivity at certain crucial moments of the film. My only criticism of this movie is that Tom Cruise was focued upon too much.  It would have been nice if the other characters, Ujio, Taka, and Katsumoto, received more screen time since they were all so likeable and each delivers a great performance.  Slight criticism aside, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and one I would recommend to virtually anyone who asked.
 By far this is the best movie that I've seen in a long while.  Not only does it depict strong issues about honor, trust, integrity, values, sound morals, lodyalt, duty, and respect, but it also shows a deeper sense of love and loving than I've seen ages.  Here is a movie full of passionate love, but no blatant sex acts.  Yeah!!!  That was a wonderful departure from the norm.  Ken Watunabe's role was AWESOME!!!  This is a great movie.
 I can't find the words to describe this truly amazing movie. I was not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, but since it looked like it would be pretty good from the preview, I decided I had to see it. This movie exceeded my expectations. Tom Cruise really surprised me and delivered such a wonderful performance in this movie. I feel that this movie was a gipped from being nominated for an Oscar. I thought for sure it would have been. If the Last Samuari had been nominated for an Oscar, and if, The Lord of the Rings
 This Movie by far is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life!!!!! No kidding! Its about damn time they came out with a movie like this! I'm surprised to see Tom Cruise in it for I had under estimated his acting abilities! I give him as well as Ken Watanabe great props!!!! They are truly wonderful actors and now one of my most favorites..... I cant tell you how great this movie was! It moved me in sooooo many ways... Ways as in the movie having parts that were funny, a lot of actions parts, and the best of all the dramatic parts... I like seriously cried 3 times!!! And I havn't done sooo in a long time when watching a movie!!! That just tells you how more powerful this movie is!!! It takes you there with all the Japanese Samurais and gives you another perspective on that kind of people.... Leaving the movies had me at a higher respect and a new look at the Japanese culture! for I give a lot of respect to them and what they've done!!!    This movie has been definitly life changing for me and I recommend it to Everyone!!!!!
 I was bored one Sunday evening and happen to catch this on TV.  I really had no anticipation that it would be a good movie.  I was wrong.  It has a full spectrum of emotions running through it.  Tom Cruze is not my favorite actor but he was suburb in this movie.  I immediately bought it from Amazon on Blue Ray.  Highly recommend it.
 I had owned this dvd and watched it many times! This is a cinematic spectacle with lush cinematography and action, as well as a fantastic storyline! I wanted to watch it one day and could not find it! I literally went right to amazon.com and ordered it and am happy I did. It definately makes my top 25 films of all time in a collection of over 7000 titles! Go out and get this movie if you have not seen it. You'll be glad you did! Michael
 This is one of the best action movies since interview with the vampire. Don't know how anyone can rate it less than 5 stars. Great drama/action. 
 THE LAST SAMURAI doesn't stand up to anything by Kurosawa, but it did prove that Tom Cruise could act, and it is a very watchable film. For one thing, Ken Watanabe, and Koyuki were simply superb, the cinematography, costuming, battle scenes, and music were glorious, and despite the highly fictionalized portrayal of samurai in this period of Japan's history it is a great story, with memorable characters, and one of the most sensual 'dress' sequences ever.
 If you are interested in Japanese history/culture such as Samurai, you will obviously like any Samurai related movie.  This is not just any Samurai related movie, Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast make this movie a must see if you haven't already seen it, and a must buy for ANYONE'S DVD collection!
 While this movie may be set in Japan during it's early industialization, at the end of the Samurai's reign (don't take that literally), that is not what this movie is about.  For anyone who's interested in what went on historically at the time, and it's acuracy, go find something else.  For anyone else, especially those with friends or family who may be returning from serving overseas in Iraq or Afganastan, this movie can help give you a small glimpse of the conflict those who fight face.  At it's heart this movie is about a soldier, who was forced into a battle that was against everything he thought was right.  How it took a toll on him, his hate for himself and others.  And his personal road to reclaiming his personal honor, and mental health.  It also shows how we can learn from other cultures if we just take the time to understand them.  Even now in places we consider the "third world there are aspects of various cultures we can still learn from.  Technology and all it's benefits are great, but it's the human spirit that is mankinds greatest tool or weapon, depending on how it's used at any time.  Definitely not something to be missed
 This turned out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. I knew this film could easily be misunderstood, and whereas I had doubts myself in the beginning, after watching it they had all but removed and I was in love with it. As with all good films, this one had picked the right people to play the characters. This had included Katsumoto, Omura, Emperor, Taka, Simon Graham, the Americans, even the guardian. It smartly blends in the flares and drama in both American and Japanese cultures and anyone who can appreciate both cultures can easily testify to great illustration of both. The film could easily be misunderstood for a few reasons
 I'm not big on movies. This one is big. I don't normally watch R movies. This one is R because of the realistic battle scenes.  I was struck with character quality after character quality throughout the movie. By the end of it, my soul was ringing with words like, 'courage, valor, honor, dignity, purity, perfection'. I have to say that I felt I was educated in Japanese history/culture to a degree by this movie.  I have to say that Ken Watanabe is great in this movie. The battle scenes are 'glorious', and the shifts from normal speed to slo-mo are perfect.  Sound also has some zoom effects that don't distract, but add to the themes of this movie. It is a movie I will watch again sometime.  Excellent movie.  You should see it if you haven't yet.  I think it will make you want to go to Japan (it had that effect on me).
 This is Tom Cruise at his greatest. The film's tone, mood, action, acting, directing, sets, and scenes (especially the exteriors) were magnificent!!! This is a movie with a heart, and Tom's gradual transformation--from savage soldier to honorable fighter--was refreshing and uplifting. Buy it and keep it. You'll want to see it many times, as each viewing shows you how very much more there is than when you saw it earlier. I can't praise this movie enough, and believe me, I'm a harsh critic, especially when I note something unbelievable and phony. Enjoy!
 The best acting from Cruise since Magnolia. Great scenery, wonderful actors, especially magnificent Ken Watanabe. A crucial moment in Japan's history, good action, lots of sincere drama. All these are just trimmings, they would have been enough to make the movie interesting but the movie is not an action, or historical drama, or adventure.  The movie is about that sad period of human history when individual values were sacrificed to obedience to orders, personal warrior skill and art replaced with cheap soldier "cannon fodder mass, indiviudal honor and responsibility gave way to the power of human rabble.  It was easier to show on Japan's example but same thing gradually happened in Europe and US as well - it took longer so the change was less stunning, but no less dramatic.  The movie for those who still believe in the word "honor", the movie for (who said that great phrase?) "romantics who were mugged by life".
 Excellent movie...........I highly recommend anyone who has not seen this movie should see it asap.  You will want to watch this movie more than once.
 One of, if not, the best samurai movies ever.  Why do people say Cruise was miss cast, he did a great job and should have been nominated for an oscar.  The movie also should have been nominated for the best picture oscar.  The story was great, very true to the way of the samurai, and very dramatic.  The action was intense and incredible, the ninja attack and the last battle are o so very cool.  The performances were good all around esspecially Tom and Ken.  I give it a 10 out of a 10, because boys and girls movies don't get much better then this.
 This is a great movie to show in history classes.  It's a great tool of showing how Japan was "westernized.  The no need for Samurai, the American training of Japanese troops, cannons, guns, the awful machine gun.  Even Western style clothing, electricity, and modernization of mostly everything.  And give you an idea how the samurai and their families lived.  Not only is this a great teaching tool but it's great entertainment.  It's not that bad of a movie.  There's a little humor in it and some serious moments where you can actually learn something about life itself.  This movie has actually sparked my interest in the Japanese history.  I do believe this movie does open your eyes a little to of pre-modern Japan and the changes Emporer Meiji made.  It's a good buy.
 I have wathched this movie and must say that it was great, the dialogue was very nicely  done and the acting was also okay.I am not a movie critique(I personally think they are never satisfied).But I think that before you critique this film I suggest you watch it first fully to understand.Many of the people who critisize this movie do so because they focused on only bits and not the whole picture,(in doing so then all movies are not perfect)--when you read some of the reviews of this movie you will wonder--"to what level should we critique a movie???should we critique the directors own story descisions??--in doing so doesn't that put as above the director and above the story??(the movie stops being the directors movie and hence becomes the movie-critique's movie).This is absurd since the story and drama the director planned to let the audience feel is lost upon the audiences own ignorance to accept what directors work)  This movie is about samurai so expect alot of blood and gore.but it still has some good dramatic content to keep you glued to the screen till the end.  Basically if want a good story with lots of beatiful scenes and lots of action then watch this film.but if you watch this film like a movie critique looking for small bits to critique then I am afraid no movie will satisfy you.--because if people can critisize such a nice movie what about the ones which really need help????(i do admit there are some which are extremely disappointing but this one is not one of them)--enjoy this movie!!!
 In a day of movies based solely on how much special effects they can pack in 2 hours, this is really a different movie. Yes, there are battles with blood spilled all over but this is accessory to the plot. The story is what appealed to me. The old Japan is lost and it is a shame. This revives it and exposes people to the Japanese culture. Being able to turn back the clock and achieve this level of realism and show the lost pride of the Japanese is an  amazing feat. Of course there is a touch of Hollywood but that's ok. Cruise is at his best in this movie surrounded by talented Japanese actors. Ken Watanabe is simply brilliant.
 The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, the kind of epic that David Lean might have made.  The film is true to historical events that happened in Japan during 1876-77.  In particular, meticulous care was taken with the recreation of Tokyo and the clothing that was being worn, traditional Japanese and modern clothing. The clash of tradition versus the influence of the West is sharply portrayed in these contrasts. Like all historical epics, departures and simplifications of the truth have to be made for the sake of a coherent film.  Certainly, there were no Americans fighting along with the samurai but the character of Captain Algren allows us to explore what is going on in Japan from the traditional and modernistic points of view.  What makes The Last Samurai an excellent historical film is what also makes for a great historical novel
 This is a great movie.  Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly.  This movie is more than just some excellent battle scenes.  It's about two completely different peoples learning about eachother while incresingly understanding and accepting a way of life that is not their own.  Oh, and there ARE some great battle scenes.  I was a little sceptical when I was about to watch this the first time, but it blew my expectations away, and I loved it.  Very few movies can bring this man to tears, but the end of this movie accomplished just that.  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this powerful film.
 Many have seen this wonder of a movie.  If you don't have the DVD 2 disk version, then you are missing out on so much more.  The first disc has the movie and right after that they have the full movie again but this time with the directors commentary on every aspect of the film as it plays.  The second disk has special features including interviews with the actors and what I think is worth the price of the DVD by itself
 It's really 90/100 No, it's no way near perfect b/c Hollywood made this film.  Why you'd wannna buy it
 If you are in to movies like Spartacus, Braveheart and Gladiator, then this should be on your list of movies to check out. The Last Samurai is about a captain, played by Tom Cruise, from the US army in the late 1800s that is sent to Japan to train soldiers in the way of modern warfare. Tom Cruise's character ends up getting captured by the enemy, who are a civilization of samurai warriors who have chosen to uphold the ancient traditions of Japan.  Throughout the movie, there is a conflict of interest between the new and old traditions and it is interesting to see the ways of the samurai throughout the film. There are both small fights and epic battles, both of which are done very well and are very entertaining to watch. Through all of the culture, battles and story line is some amazing cinematography. On top of that, the acting was superb.  The Last Samurai is very entertaining and interesting movie that is solid from start to finish and fits in nicely with any collection of epic style movies.
 I really enjoyed it. I love historical movies of any kind and although this was a somewhat romanticized view of the historical events that occured, i still thought it was a very good film. I also bought the soundtrack-it was excellent.
 The dream
 I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan. That explains why I waited until the DVD release to rent it on Netflix. That was a mistake because this epic is all that. Maybe it is my clarity on the context surrounding the participants that caused me to be so engrossed.  I wonder how many of you are aware that the three leading industrial powers at the turn of the 20th century where Britian, Germany and Japan? Isn't it ironic that the US was not one of the elite? What is amazing is the instantaneous metamorphosis of Japan from a feudal society to a major industrial power. The setting  of this movie is about the transition from "the old ways to the new ways.  Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, formerly of the 7th Calvary, sent to Japan to train the Emperor's army in western warfare tactics. This would be the infamous Custer's calvary. The Custer who opened up "Thieves Road to the Black Hills. The same calvary that went looking for one helpless Native American village too many. The Captain left the calvary before its demise at Little Big Horn. He is imbued with nightmares from the massacre of the Southern Cheyenne. This is the first historically accurate portrayal of Custer EVER by Hollywood.  These two contexts are the heart of this movie and it is amazing to see how a cowboy becomes an indian. Cruise isn't bad in this movie but I'm not raving about it because of him. The Japanese actors are absolutely engrossing in their first film before western audiences. They are credible and believable and there is a complete absence of the overacting ubiquitious in so many films. Ken Watanabe has the key role as the Last Samurai leader, Katsumoto, who is dedicated heart and soul to the code of bushido. He is also the heart and soul of this movie. Shin Koyamada plays Nobutada, the son of Katsumoto and is unforgettable. We are also introduced to a captivatingly beautiful actress Koyuki, who plays the sister of Katsumoto and wife of a samurai slain by Algren.  There are so many great lines and enveloping dialogue but the best is when Cruise character tells Colonel Bagley
 I saw this movie in the theatre and loved it-- action, drama, history, it had it all. Tom Cruise was excellent, oscar worthy in my opinion, but the costars also gave powerful performances. I am buying this movie on DVD when it is released!
 Ive never been much of a Tom Cruise fan untill i went to see this film. What can i say but an all action film just brilliant tom should win an oscar.
 1876 in Japan, an American soldier named Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has been hired by the Emperor Meijii to train some Japanese soldiers to fight against the savage Samurai. He does get captured by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) while in battle as he is brought to their village, Nathan begins to learn the ways of their life and even becomes one of the people for 2 years as learns to switch sides to fight on their side for honor and love.  An amazing and sweeping old fashioned epic historical fiction drama from the director of the modern classic "Glory Edward Zwick is one of the decade's best pictures. Co-starring Tony Goldwyn, Billy Connelly and Hiroyuki Sanada Koyuki this is a well made and violent adventure film that has a familar old story. Although very similar to films like "Man Named Horse", "Dances with Wolves", "Lawrence of Arabia or "Last of the Mohicans this one takes the old story of those to Japan instead of being in the western times or the French-Indian war or Arabia. The acting is flawless as is the direction, the action sequences are gory and well made and the photography is just stunning as is Han Zimmer's score.  This Blu-Ray offers quality picture in a great transfer that looks fresher and the sound is good as well and the extras include audio commentary, History Channel Documentary
 This is a must have for any fan of samurai period drama, and now with the advanced Blu-ray tecnology it's even better. As a fan of Japanese culture and history, this film holds up fairly well. Tom Cruise's is somewhat typical for him...a bit over the top, but bearable.  There was a nice transition from languages to illustrate his communication with the Japanese samurai. I still would have preferred Cruise learning the language and seeing it almost entirely subtitled, but that's not a viable approach for Hollywood. Nevertheless, the director did a good job of capturing the culture. Even though I tend to be a purist, it's possible to watch this film and be entertained, despite some inaccuracies.  This is more a review of the movie itself rather than the disk, sorry! It has some nice extra features and enhancements over the original DVD version.
 My profile 43 yo no qualifications as a movie critic  Browsing through the reviews (there is just too many), I stopped after finding out one reviewer who reflected on why this movie was not that popular in the US and why it it was almost not mentioned in the Oscar (that was my impression at least).. Well, the reviewer said something about the view of the "whiteman's burden made have caused unpleasant reactions.. that could be part of the reason, but my opinion is, the movie was released at a bad political timing and was censored by Hollywood as part of the "Patriot canpaign designed at getting moral support to the invasion of Irak  Now you may label me now as a "conspiracy paranoid", but let me deliniate some aspects too see if they are not logical.. in the movie, americans go to Japan as mercenaries with a agenda of opening the big arms trade with imperial Japan.. to make matters worse, an ethical crisis occurs to the character of Tom Cruise.. an actor who is still remembered as a patriotic pilot who shot down those dreaded MICs in "Top Gun ( a movie destined to make the public feel good at their defense expenditure)... talk about a bad timing to reflect and see that your goverment; not only sends you to genocide the american indians, now its time to continue somewhere else!! and what's even worse, he joins the other side!!, not exactly the kind of attitude you need on the troop morale sent to invade Irak under weak grounds.. hell, was it not enough the catharsis done by all those Vietnam movies? (where Tom Cruise did a Nam veteran).. well that was then this is now... lets face it.. why such an epic movie, a superb production and  what I consider Cruise's pass to inmortality in the world of true films, was given a "foreign movie treatment??!!  Perhaps after the dust settles and a new peace period begins, this movie can be seen in its proper context..
 Comparisons to "Dances with wolves apart, "The last samurai is a very enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise, maybe in his best performance ever, plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of the Civil War that now lives in oblivion as an alcoholic ad-boy for a weapons company. He's invited to Japan to train the Imperial Army against a bunch of rogue samurai. The Imperial Army represents the new Japan (in 1876), a nation that has turned its eyes to the western world. The samurai represent the old japanese style, fighting without fire weapons, living a life of discipline, simplicity, commitment and respect for the nature, etc.  This clash of so different cultures is what makes this movie interesting. Besides, there are many dialogues spoken in japanese (what helps create the correct atmosphere), the costumes and figurines are excellent, and the battle scenes, that some people found to be not well-represented and slow, caught my attention every time.  Not only Tom Cruise is good, though a little too intense; the girl Koyuki and, especially, this amazing actor Ken Watanabe play their parts with a tremendous ease and desenvolture, giving us, westerners, a glimpse of what japanese culture is (or was).  OK, the script is Hollywood from beginning to end, but, nonetheless, Edward Zwick did a competent job, just like he did in another exceptional movie, "Glory". I did not enoy "The las samurai because of its story, but because its very well enacted, colorful and it portraits one of the most interesting cultures in the world. Maybe something that helped me like this movie is the fact that I've never watched (and I'm ashamed to say so) an Akira Kurosawa movie.  Grade 8.7/10
 One of history's great ironies is that the machine gun was designed with the goal of making war more humane.  This is an expression of a reality that the makers of The Last Samurai seem to be highly aware of
 A beautiful tale of a man finding redemtion in an unlikely plave....but the beauty of Zwicks battles and scenery are overshadowed by a typically hollywood liberla anit-American view. SOMEHOW in the background of Japan becoming a modern society, and ending centuries of Feudalism, the United States become the BAY GUY. Japanese serfs, striving for freedom, are not the Enemy. Samurai opressors are not the Enemy. 1 whiteman is the enemy. 1 American is the enemy. it's all summed up on the eve of the battle between the modern serf army and the traditional samurai army, when asamurai child ask's Tom Cruise "Will you fight the WHITE MEN"? Of course there is only ONE whiteman. And the whole army of dirty serfs struggling to breathe free is irrelevent. It's the white American's fault. Centuries of feudalist opression is summed up into "ONE WHITE MAN". 5 stars for battle scenes and general movie macgic. -1 for silly political ideology where it does not belong and is totally out of context.
 "The Last Samurai is, without a doubt, one of the finest action epics thatI have seen ever since "Braveheart"! "The Last Samurai is one of those rare films that combine a sweeping, heroic epic with an intimate, extremely poignant personal story of love, honor, and tenderness. The direction of Edward Zwick ("Glory", "Courage Under Fire") was top-notch and powerful! And the performance of superstar Tom Cruise ("Minority Report") was unforgettable! Surely one of the best Tom Cruise performances since "Top Gun"! The film focuses on Nathan Algren (Cruise), a decorated war hero (from the war against the American Indians) now drunkenly relegated to showing off new gun technology at expositions. Algren is offered handsome compensation to leave the States and help bring Japan into the modern age of guns and to suppress a revolt of nontechnological samurai making trouble in the hinterlands. During a raid that is botched by unready troops, Algren is captured but not before managing to cleverly kill off one of the most accomplished samurai. The samurai lord, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed with Algren's magificent fighting spirit and resourcefulness and decides to nurse him back to health so that he might learn more about his enemy. The premise revealed. I will skip the rest of the plot, saying only that it is inevitable that Algren comes to respect and then love the ways of his captors and becomes himself an accomplished warrior in their disciplined traditions. He soon allies himself against his former compatriots and must learn what true honor is and how both life and death can help one reach his destiny. Essentially, and I do not say this casually, this film is "Dances with Wolves set among the Japanese "other rather than the American "other". The film started like a Tom Cruise movie, stopped being one for a fascinating hour or so, and then returned to its Hollywood roots. When we first see Cruise, he is doing his trademark Cruise acting
 As epic movies go,  The Last Samurai  is a superb one despite any historical inaccuracies which is what the History Channel is for.  All of the big named male actors such as Mel Gibson and Russell Crowe had their epic war movies and Tom Cruise was sorely due for one and in this movie he chose very well.  Over the years, like many super stars, Tom Cruise has chosen some extremely good roles and at the other end of the spectrum he's done some very poor movies but with  The Last Samurai,  the part couldn't have been better for him as it was supremely suited to his talents. Along with the superior performance given by Tom Cruise, his co-actors in Timothy Spall, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada and Koyuki and so many others added greatly to the overall feel of the movie through their performances which were all of great depth and feeling. Over the years, Edward Zwick has directed some of the finest movies to ever grace the silver screen such as  Glory  and  Legends of the Fall  and  The Last Samurai  serves well to his legacy by being added to his library of exceptional films.  Additional credit goes to Hans Zimmer for the score for this outstanding film. The Premise
 After scanning some of the negative reviews posted here I must say I am shocked to learn that ANYONE could find this movie anything but exceptional. The words "boring and "tedious have no place desrcibing this exceptional film. It's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, full of humor, poetry and sensuality and considering the fact that it is of course A MOVIE (for those of you overly concerned with real looking sets, etc), I was mesmerized and entertained for the 2 plus hours I was watching this great movie. My wife, who reluctantly attended the sneak preview, fell so in love with this film that she insists on seeing it again on Friday when it makes its full release. There will always be the inevitable haters and those comparing it to Dances With Wolves, etc, but disregard those folks and go see what is sure to be an Oscar Winner. You won't be disappointed.
 After the opening of Japan in 1853 under the pressure of the US and their Perry expedition, and the restoration of Imperial power in 1867, things went very fast. Japan was modernized at first to the best profit of the USA. But this development brought strong resistance within Japan from the feudal order of the Samourais, and a very agressive expansion on the Asian continent. This film concentrates on the final push against feudalism and its old code of honor represented by the Samourais. This change was particularly brutal with imported weapons from the USA, an exclusive contract, and military counsellors. The move was led by some big capitalist families who were ruthless about the change and who violently eradicated all opposition to the final death of it and them. The film shows this very well. The character Tom Cruise embodies here is probably fictitious but it links the wars against the Indians in the US to this war against mountain tribes and villages in Japan. The same objective 
 I really loved this movie. The way it was just presented and keeping the history and culture of Samurai. Yet it was not a true story nor based on any actual accounts or characthers. The story itself sparks an interest in Japanese and Samurai warrior history. From the code of Honor down to commiting Seppuku. Im not going to get into a brush of History on the Samurai, theres much too explain and learn about those fearsome Warriors.    It should and definetly leaves the audience in awe about such a war and time when fuedal clans and government corruption brought femine that you would want to learn and research about these class of noble warriors on the web or at your local libary. The Samurai sword Katana has a whole long history in itself.    But this movie defenitly brings out what the Samurai truly are and what they believed in and fought for, or as Mr. Grahm said it; "HONOR". To this day, I believe there is no other warriors who were or can be more dedicated or honorable than the samurai.    Being a modern Warrior myself in the u.s. Army as an infantry Ranger, I can attest to this. We have honor just like all other warriors, but I believe not as much to the extent of the warrior Samurai.
 I can't get enough of this movie. The Last Samurai is a powerful tale that stays with you. I can't get enough of this modern masterpice.  Capt. Nathan Algren(Cruise) is an Army veteran. He's become an alcholic and hates himself and frequently has flashbacks over some of the Indians he's killed. He's falling apart and things don't look great for him until he's offered a job by the ambassador of Japan Umura(Hamada).  The Emperor of Japan is modernizing the country and doing it very quickly. The Emperors former advisor Katsumota(Watanabe) doesn't like the old ways and is doing everything in his power to delay them. He is one of the greatest Samurai to ever live and is well respected and loved by his people. Umura nows Japan can't beat him so he convinces the Emperor that they must modernize so they can defeat Katsumoto.  Algren comes to Japan reluctantly. He hates Col. Bagley(Goldwyn) who is his superior officer in the operation. He's trying to train the Japanese men as fast as he can, but they don't have a enough time. Umura and Bagley order Algren to takes his men into battle against Katsumoto agains his will.  The fight between the armies is quick and very bloody. Katsumoto captures Algren after seeing the passion and fire in his eyes during battle. They take Algren back to their village for winter so Katsumoto can get to learn his enemy better.  Algren is treated fairly well by the people. They help him overcome his alcholism battle. He hates the place at first, but as he lives there and sees the discipline of the Samurai people he begins to accept and love their culture. He becomes friends with Katsumoto and gains respect from most of the village. Winter ends though and he must return to Tokyo.  Upon his return to Tokyo he sees the advance of the Japanese army. Umora has increased the spending of Japan in their arms and it's obvious he has lots of influence over the emperor. Umora is determined to kill the Samurai and Katsumoto. After a scuffle in Tokyo Algren returns with the Samurai to help prepare them in their last stand against the Japanese army.  The acting is phenomenal in this movie. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in their roles as Algren and Katsumoto. Cruise plays the role with passion and intensity. He does a great job displaying the change that Algren takes emotionaly and physically. He really did get cheated by not getting an Oscar nomination. This guy has done a lot for the movie industry and the academy but they continue to not pay him back. Cruise almost didn't do this movie because of his commitment to Cold Mountain. They didn't give the money he wanted so he became The Last Samurai.   Ken Watanabe really shines in this picture. He isn't intimidated by Cruise at all and is equal if not better to him. He becomes Katsumoto and is amazing. He's funny, brave, charming, and smart all at the same time. He deserved the Oscar nomination he received and probaly should have won it. I'm excited about seeing Ken in the new Batman movie. This guy is great.  Edward Zwick really does a great job with this movie. The Last Samurai is produced by Cruises production company and they were the only man they wanted to direct this. Zwick has plenty of experience in this area of movies with Glory on his resume. He shots this movie well and it's all done in tastes. The fight scenes are shot especially well. The camera angles are great and we really get a good idea of how the Samurai fought. The violence isn't over done and you see the art that is sword play. Zwick has made a masterpiece.  A lot of people have bashed the ending of the movie. They think it's sappy and to happy. It's anything but that. If you pay attention to the movie and realize that Algren didn't fail his mission he has no shame. Algren loved Katsumoto and so did the Emperor so thats why we have that scene at the ending of the well. I found it to be a powerful ending to a dynamic film.  This is a great movie. It's so well made and attention is paid in it to the tiniest details. This movie will stay with you for days and all the good dramas do. If you like dramas or war films than you must see this film. If you love Tom Cruise you have to pick this one up. You won't regret buying this one.
  The Last Samurai  is one of the greatest historical epics of our generation. The battle scenes are created with great action and detail, as are the solo sword fights. And while the action is breathtaking, they only help to tell an amazing yet somber story of honor, sacrifice and change. Tom Cruise gives what is possibly the performance of his career, and Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Katsumoto (He was robbed at the Oscars). While I haven't yet had time to view the special features, none are really needed, for this film could stand on its own! Any fan of true film will want this epic in their collection! Movie/DVD Grade
  The Last Samurai  was certainly one of the best movies of 2003.  The main story is a reverent account of the character of the Japanese people and the Samurai in particular, but there's much more to it than simply that.  The film has many subplots and resolves them all neatly without ever seeming contrived.  Everything from Algren's (Tom Cruise) search for peace to his understated yet elegant love story with Taka (Koyuki) is handled as well as it conceivably could be.  Writer John Logan avoids the overwrought melodrama that burdens most war movies; everything is as quietly graceful as the Samurai way of living depicted within the film. The acting is, on every front, excellent.  Tom Cruise gives an uncharacteristically melancholy performance as Captain Nathan Algren, while Ken Watanabe perfectly encapsulates the quiet honor of Samurai leader Katsumoto.  The actors cast in the supporting roles are equally suited to the film, each giving realistic and powerful performances by turns. Director Edward Zwick infuses the entire film with the necessary serene feel.  He uses well-placed camera angles to complement and enhance the already magnificent sets, and even cliched choices (such as Algren's choppy, blurred memories) are handled competently.  The only area that Zwick falls a little short in is in his directing of the action.  Despite the R rating of the film, he displays a timidity in his direction which, at times, makes it blatantly obvious that these are stunts.  Even still, this movie is not an action film, and it's appropriate that Zwick kept it from becoming a visceral bloodbath.  This isn't too say that there aren't graphic depictions of violence, but Zwick generally avoids the blatant displays which fill movies like  Kill Bill , preferring to quickly cut away from gory moments. If  The Last Samurai  has a real problem, it's that the story is about somewhat immaterial concepts
 The Last Samurai is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Anything under five stars in an absurd rating. I simply couldn't understand how this movie didn't even get a nomination for an Oscar while Lord of the Rings got every award on the planet. The only one any of those movies deserves is Best Special Effects. Nevertheless, The Last Samurai has all the elements of a true classic. Hyped-out to be a story about the last rebellion of the Samurai in 1877, I believe the movie's more profound than that. It's really about the struggle of Captain Nathan Algren (played amazingly by Tom Cruise) and his quest to find peace, after turning to the bottle to combat his tremendous guilt for slaughtering Native Americans in the cavalry raids. The story was passionate, exciting, beautifully written, directed, and acted, and I don't understand how it wasn't anything more than a smash-success.
 A drunken Civil War hero, Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) was assigned to train Japanese soldiers in 1876. "The Last Samurai is a film about honor. Algren went from being a drunken fool to a hero on the battlefield. Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) took Algren captive and began to teach him the code. The movie is excellent.
 The Last Samurai was one of those exceptionally rare films that I am sure I'll always remember.  The character of Katsumoto was magnificent, and Tom Cruise did a superb job portraying the captive who learned to find meaning in his life from a people very different.  I too became a captive of the discipline, honor, and other virtues depicted in the Samurai culture.  It was a completely absorbing movie...I hated for it to end.  Speaking of the end, I couldn't imagine how it could end well, and thought it a shame to watch 2 1/2 hours just to see the bad guys win.  But it actually had a fantastic ending--very satisfying.  I don't want to spoil it for those reading reviews who haven't seen the movie yet!  If you like action movies, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this one...I'd give it 10 stars!
 I keep getting drawn back to this. I believe that this is Tom Cruise best movie. His acting was very good, but I think the story, and more importantly the exposure to Martial Arts values is what makes this film. Having studied many years under a true Korean Master, the "DO way of life is the most important thing I have learned. This movie gives a glimpse of that.
 I love this movie.  There are few movies I can watch over and over.  This would be one.  I am a fan of Tom Cruise but not a fanatic fan.  He is a very nice looking man and can act fairly well. But I don't see any Oscars in his future.  That being said, I have enjoyed many of his films and look forward to many more.  I think he did a wonderful performance in this picture, however, even if he weren't in the picture, it could have stood on its own.  Ken Watanabe is a superb actor, not to mention a very sexy man who played Katsumoto.  Other actors of note include
 Set in Japan during the 1870s, Tom Cruise plays Capt. Nathan Algren, an American military leader hired to train Japan's army in modern warfare. He is a drunk mercenary tortured by his inner demons. In his first encounter against the Samurai, Algren is captured by Katsumoto, played brilliantly by Ken Watanabe. He quickly is impressed by the Samurai's skills in battle and unexpectedly drawn to their way of life while in captivity. Ultimately, he finds himself at Katsumoto's side, driven by his sense of honor.  This is a great film and probably Tom Cruise's best. It is beautifully written and acted. It is also loaded with brilliant cinematography and amazing battle choreography. An epic and worth mentioning with such great films like Gladiator and Braveheart! A must own for any collector.  NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS
 This is an excellent movie, and the blu-ray edition does it justice. The picture quality is amazing, bright colors, infifnite detail, consistent three dimensionality. This is a must own for blu-ray fans.
 Is this what we were all waiting for??  YES!!!  Incredible image. Crisp. Rich. Full of detail. Incredible contrast. Amazing colors. This is exactly what HDTV is all about.  HD-DVD really got me. I was once a Blu-ray supporter, but now I've got to admit. HD-DVD is simply doing what it was suposed to do
 Well worth the purchase if you're a fan of the movie.  The second dvd has loads of nice extras, too.  If you have a large screen tv, defintely get the widescreen version.
 I love this movie!!! I saw it in theaters and loved every second of it. It is the reason that I love Japan and Samurai. What I like most about it isn't just the cinematics but the moral behind it. Honor...
 Set in 1870's Japan, `The Last Samurai' is the story Japan's struggle to come to terms with the modern world whilst at the same time embracing its traditional past.  Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly good performance as the tormented Nathan Algren, a former captain of the US army who is having trouble with his conscience, unusual in a white man in the 19th century but he is haunted by his past, a past which saw him play a role in the slaughter of innocent Native American men, women and children in his own country.  Algren eventually agrees to go to Japan to help train its soldiers in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the Samurai forces that are still clinging to the old ways.  Algren takes on this task for money and no other reason, he does not care about anything or anyone, death is no longer something he fears and it is partly this lack of fear that saves his life when he is captured by the `enemy,' who take him to their camp and inadvertently bring him spiritually closer to the way of the Samurai.  Algren slowly falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honour and he eventually switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the Samurai against the people he was brought over to train.  He forges a tenuous relationship with Taka, the widow of the man he killed in battle, and becomes a father figure to her two young sons and wins the grudging respect of the Samurai sword trainer who tries to break his spirit and his bones.  The film does to a certain extent become a study in redemption as Algren strives to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the guilt of his dishonourable past actions.  Eventually though Algren comes to realise he cannot erase the past, he can either live with it or let it crush him.  He chooses to live but only as a Samurai, and that could mean his death at any given moment.  The whole film was a vibrant, violent, passionate look into a past that Japan has never been able to reclaim since the days of the Samurai.  With the western world on the doorstep trying to force their way in, Japan had to let go of some of her ancient traditions to survive and in doing so lost a big part of herself.  The Last Samurai has been accused of being too much on the side of the Samurai, but I think it manages to find a kind of balance, with both good and bad on both sides, and the over all film certainly deserves the five stars I am giving it.  Cruise does well not to fluff the Japanese language too much in the movie, I liked that they used subtitles, it gave the movie considerable authenticity, and the fight scenes as gory as they were, were breathtaking to watch, along with a fabulous musical score and scenery that I can't even do justice to in this critique.  A movie I will be watching again I think, because you cannot honestly take everything in, in just one viewing.  By far one of the best movies to come out of 2003 in my opinion.
 In a word, WOW! This has got to be one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre. The story is post-Civil War where a lot of the war heroes were unemployed and out of place. Tom Cruise, one of those war heroes who becomes disenchanted with the war and flees to a bottle, is contacted by war buddies and signs on to train an army for Japan to wipe out the samurai. Although he feels his new command is unable to fight, his superiors put the troops to the combat test. As they fail, Cruise is captured and taken captive by the samurai. Without giving the entire plot away, the scenery, locations, and acting were top notch. It is the old ways vs. the new ways and it seems for awhile that the new ways are better. Watch this movie today, buy it tomorrow.
 This is a great movie, their is nothing more to say. Why has Tom not won an Academy Award yet? You would figure after Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, The Firm, Days of Thunder,Vanilla Sky, well you get the picture.
 Let me start by saying that I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan.  That said, this movie is a great movie.  While Cruise is the main character and the story is sort of told through him, there is more emphasis on the character Katsumoto, and Japan as the setting, and the story line.  When we see a Tom Cruise film, he is usually the center of the film and always a larger than life character.  It's hard to feel for him or relate to him.  Here he is portrayed more human, there is more feeling and he is not quite as self-centered in his performance, not as cocky.  The cinematography is beautiful and the story is captivating.  You feel for the samurai and are frustrated with the emperor, and you are actually happy with the way it all ends, in a bittersweet way.  I loved it!  Great movie!
 What we should appreciate before we get too deep into the odd story of Captain Algren is that he/it is strikingly similar to John Blackthorne, the English pilot of a Dutch ship that ends up in Japan in Clavell's near genius-like rendition of  Shogun.  Without discrediting Tom Cruise who acted brillinatly I thought, the story does live up to general aspects of the  Shogun  tale but falls short in  a few other areas. The love affair with Cruise and Taka is sweet but with Blackthorne and Mariko it was detailed, passionate, forbidden and conspiratorial. Likewise, the transition that Cruise makes into Japanese society is in fact, believable however it seems to happen swiftly. Too swiftly to remain completely credible. The script and Cruise's voiceover explains his love of the discipline and simplicity, which interestingly enough is what seduces Blackthorne. Well. Really seduces Blackthorne. But then again, it is Nathan that/who becomes a true warrior, and I must again give kudos to Cruise who appears believable in the great physicality of the Bushido spirit and the battle scenes. All in all a nice ride, sufficient enough to take it out of the 'manly men doing manly things' genre and allow you to think. Ken Wanatabe as Katsumoto is excellent and should have won him a best supporting. Taka is wonderful; the children are animated and innocent. The use of Cruise speaking Japanese was an excellent touch and again, seemed to add credibility. I should also mention that there are similar 'blood lines' in the Indian Rights oriented  A Man Called Horse,  less interesting, less fulfilling, but possibly equally provacative.  Good job to all. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
 American guy coes to Japan to ttain Japense soilders to fight th rebilain, but he goes to the rebliain villaige and finds out there peaceful way of living. Later, of course, he becomes a samurai. This is cool film. Really liked pretty Japanse actress, the big fight, and the fact that it is Japan( Every thing good comes from Japan). This is a cool film. You'll like it.
 Comparing Samurai to Nazi's is just plain stupid!  Should we compare the US army in the 1870's to Nazi's?  Is this movie history? I think so.  Not because of the events as depicted in the movie, but for an attempt to capture a people's values at some point of time. It was closer to bringing that viewpoint to life than even Kurosawa's epics which were influenced heavily by Shakesphere and other western themes. We forget that the stories of King Arthur are very large fabrications of the West's transition point to from the time of the ancients to middle ages, that the knights virtues in writing were pure but in reality they were brutal instead of kind.  That is the point of movies, to inspire and build up our view of humanity while being careful not to extoll to heavilly the  villains. Tom Cruise's redemption after massacring Indians is one point of the film. How he finds peace and honor is another. How a society of traditional values finds itself eclipsed by the modern values of greed are clearly evident themes in both modern Japan and the US (whether it is true or not is not the point).  Can something in the Samurai spirit of the film be used to inspire us? Or must we only see this in films about hobbits and dwarfs (partially inspired by the horrors that Tolkein saw in WWI?  Technically the sword tactics were very well done and remain one of the few films that captures kenjutsu correctly. Cruise worked his tail off to make it credible and despite the time it would really would take to do so, it was still done well.  The filming in Japan was fantastic. The Meiji period where foreigners saw Japan as another China full of savages to be conquered is captured quite well. The Emperor who found himself in a position he was not prepared to handle with advisorsthat took advantage of him is also quite well captured. The leader of the Samurai was also well liked by the common people (then named a street after him shortly after he died) may not be the exact historical replica of the man but most of the Samurai following were "pissed at loosing their swords and topknots which represented critical parts of their heritage, not about attacking Korea. So the question is...do we want a documentary or a movie to inspire us?
 Amazing story, great cinematography.  For how ling this movie is, it's over way too fast.  Amazon streaming does a fantastic job, never had a buffering issue.
 Remember that boring long mini series back in 1982 called Shogun?! Well... this movie is like that but better and shorter version; less than three hours! It's only 154 minutes long to be exact! Anyway, Tom Cruise delivers his finest performance as an ex-civil war hero who is hired to go to Japan and train the modern army against the samurais. However, during the first losing battle, he was captured and held as a prisoner at the camp filled with trained samurais. Then he falls in love with a wife of the slained warrior he killed during the first war in Japan. While he is living in the village as a "slave"; he learns the culture of the samurai people. Then he learns how to fight like them as well. After he is released and returned back to the then modern day Tokyo, he isn't welcomed among friends because he wears the samurai clothes instead of civilian clothes of the 1860's. Then Samurai General is kidnapped and thrown in the dungeon. Tom rescues him from prison  and escapes back to the village. They prepares for the war the following week. The final battle scene is amazing how sword bound samurais fighting rifle shooting Japanese army. And I will not tell you about the ending because you must buy this DVD! It's superb!
 Could almost be a documentary I am half Japanese and this is a very good movie People should get this movie to learn a little bit about the feudal days of Japan
 Brand new, perfect condition, good price, fast delivery.  This movie is a great story and reminds me that Tom Cruise can be way more the a Top Gun or Mission Impossible kind of guy.
 Loved this movie! Very insightful and very well written. Watching the samurai and learning about their values  and the culture was really inspiring. I will definitely watch it again!
 I really am so glad that I ordered this DVD.  Fast shipping got it to me quickly.  I really have enjoyed the story and the beauty of the movie.  I hope that others will see and enjoy this DVD as much as I have.
 Many of the reviewers liken this movie to "Dances With Wolves but though there are some similiarites, the main difference is in the main character played by Tom Cruise. I'm not always an avid fan of him and that has nothing to do with his Scientology views but this ranks as one of his best performances as a damaged Civil War vet who regains a sense of self when he encounters the Japanese culture--in particular, bushido.  Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I'm not mistaken.  Being Asian I was entranced by Zwick's sensitive direction and also by the stunning photography.  If you can get this in Hi-Def (HD-DVD or Blu-ray), I would recommend it particularly since the HD DVD price is below $10!!
 This is an amazing movie especially after watching the special features afterward. The collection of Japanese actors and their intense desire to be a part of this film... Visually beautiful with an insite to the Japanese culture. Very entertaining on several levels.
 'The Last Samurai' is a one of those films that has it's flaws but you can't help but enjoy anyway. This film follows Cruise's character as he is captured by a Samurai clan and then learns the lifestyle and ways of a Samurai whilst living in their village. Throughout the story it immerses you in aspects of the history of Japan, and although slightly stylised, gives a good feeling of life and culture in those times. It has beautiful film locations, beautiful music, a good story line and a good cast. I feel this to be one of Cruise's better films and his performance is very credible. This film may be slightly long, but it holds your interest right to the end and is a great nights viewing. Well worth considering.  Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
 This movie  was Phenomenal  the storyline surpassed my expectations.  The last Samurai is a great story The acting is great I believe this is one of if not the best Tom cruise film... If you enjoy stories about the Samurai or martial arts this movie is definitely for you...I originally thought how in the world could A movie Titled The Last Samurai Star Tom cruise,He's not Japanese?  but But i was blown away by how great this movie was and had to get it on Blu-ray disk
 The beauty and emotion of this portrayal of two very different worlds coming together was well done. I'm brought to tears every time I watch it. The soundtrack is consuming and hypnotic.
 Excellent movie!! I loved it!! Samurai are cool!! This movie is a glimpse into the history of the Samurai Warrior, and his way of life. I recommend it to anyone interested in this subject.
 Many critics and filmgoers panned Tom Cruise's performance and his lack of believability of being a samurai.  However, his performance is spot on in my opinion.  You can sense his seriousness and issues with the American army's and his own actions of the war.  You can sense his appreciation of Eastern culture and his experience as a Civil War veteran through his eyes, his body language, and the delivery of his lines.  While I thought seeing Cruise dressed as a samurai would be unbelievable, his performance transforms his character so well that by the end of the movie when he dons the samurai outfit, I was completely convinced.  Other performances are great as well, including Timothy Spall (the photographer) and especially Ken Watanabe.  The story is extremely well written and the action scenes are well done, with no extra choreography or special effects that make the action seem less authentic.  Finally, the score by Hans Zimmer.  It's easily my favorite thing about the film, and it's quite possibly the best soundtrack and score composed without being grandiose.  Zimmer uses many simplistic pieces that have two-note melodies but they're so poignant and fitting, that you can't not be moved by many scenes.  While some scenes are overly dramatic (like most of Edward Zwick's films), The Last Samurai is one of my all-time favorite films and deserves to be seen as equally as legendary and epic as similar films such as Braveheart and Gladiator.
 I WANT TO THANK THE SELLER FOR SENDING A GOOD PRODUCT WITH NO DAMAGE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS USED.  IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO ORDER WITH CONFIDENCE.  I WILL USE THIS SELLER AGAIN. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR BEING PICKY ABOUT THE SELLERS THAT YOU ALLOW TO SELL ON YOUR SITE.
 This is a good movie to watch if ur interested in samurais,which was pretty cool. When i bought this it was on sale for 9.99 and i just had to get it because i was skeptic about gettting it before because it was 20-30 bucks before and it wouldnt be worth it, because i could get some better with that money. But for the price i got it for it was a sweet deal and very good movie for those who havent seen it. It is a classic
 My husband watched this movie on tv and wanted to purchase it for his collection.  Well worth the money.
 One of Tom Cruise's best, I wish he made more films like this! Looks great on Blu-ray my Dad loves it! Thanks Amazon.
 This edition is very good. The movie is excellent and look authentic. The extra credits are also a must see and are interesting and informative.
 What a great movie the lands japan it's so beautiful in HD Blue Ray great disc.
 Anyways, this product is amazing and the quality is superb, sorry I erased by mistake the rating but the reality is that from the transaction to the delivery was correct.!!!
 Perfect.  Hans Zimmer is a true genius and he has composed here the best score of his career so far. The music transcend the movie and the landscapes are just to-die-for. I own both DVD and Bluray of this film to be able to play it whenever and wherever I want.  True, it's not so historical but never claimed to be. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride offered by a perfect cast.  Nothing to waste here, and that's quite rare so I better mention it!
 The best movie I have seen so far this year, it is absolutely wonderful. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, a must if you like good movies.
 We are huge fans of Japanese historical films and samurai epics ("Seven Samurai being the Valhalla of the genre)so we lined up early to see "Last Samurai.  I had seen the reviews with mixed feelings, fearful that Cruise's "Top Gun arrogance would crash through the culture like a Hummer. As it turned out, the Japanese cast led by Ken Watanbe keeps Cruise under control.  It was a little troubling to see Cruise's character completely master Katana technique and Iai waza in a single season, but I guess he had to to keep the plot moving.  Also, Cruise is a bit like Milton Berle - he has to be the last man off of every scene.  But Watanabe steals the movie and the supporting cast is terrific.  For once, Cruise doesn't seduce the woman who is forced to keep him in her house, and she complains that he smells bad.  In the end, the movie is a spectacular paen to Bushido culture. (I haven't yet asked an old friend of mine who survived Bataan what he thought of this movie).  The movie tackles a tricky and contradictory period of Japanese history, the great inner conflict between modernists (who won) and the feudalists, who probably were not all noble.  But heck, its the action scenes which are worth enduring Tom Cruise, and I sure liked watching him get pummeled by Watanabe's No. 2.   If Japan rejected the West as the movie ultimately indicates, it sure didn't last long.  In this respect, it has a strong similarilty to "Dances With Wolves", not only for its worshipful depiction of a dying culture, but favoring the twilight over the end.
 Tom Cruise gives a stellar performance! The historical and cultural backgrounds were perfect. The traditional Samurai sense of honor and respect prevails even through the darkest period in their history. Ken Watanabe did an outstanding job portraying Katsumoto, the strong and honorable leader of the last army of samurai. Holding out and fighting against all odds for what he believes in, honor. The only complaint i have with this movie is that it had to end. The battle scenes were nothing short of miraculous. Finally a movie that gives the samurai all of the credit they deserve! 5 STARS!
 This movie is the awesomest movie ever. I cannot wait to buy my own copy! The only real weak point in the movie was the ending, but that was made up for with the awesome battle sequences and storyline! If you liked this movie i also suggest reading Shogun, on which the movie was based.
 I do not have any interest in these kind of movies but a friend of mine wanted to see it so I went along not looking to enjoy the movie at all. Boy was I surprised at how good this movie was. It makes you feel for the Samurai and it is just a moving story all together. I don't recall seeing Ken Watanabe(Samurai's leader) in any other movie but believe me he steals the show in this one. I would compare it to Robert Duvall playing Gus in Lonesome Dove, Ken is Katsumoto. Great job by Tom Cruise, his best movie in awhile. Trust me on this one you will be pleasantly surprised at how good of a movie this is. I will own it on DVD the day it comes out.
 I wasn't too sure about the movie at first but now i'm really glad that i went to see it.  It shows an insight on what how the samurais lived, their beliefs and their values.  The main storyline, shown through focusing on the uprising of the samurai against rapid modernization, is the journey that is taken by tom cruise's character.  He goes from the disillusioned American soldier who has lost all meaning of what he was fighting for after killing innocent Native Americans to finding peace with himself and discovering something worth giving his life for. The acting was superb, the storyline was riveting, the landscape was beautiful, the music was captivating, and the battle scenes...bloody? (i didn't see much...i was hiding behind my soda).  on a shallower note, fans of legolas...in this movie, you will find a japanese legolas! kyaa! kyudo! ^_~
 "The Last Samurai is an excellent film, respectful of its source material even while telling a fictional story.  The "foreigner joins a warrior culture, taking on their strange dress and winning their respect story is well-represented on film and in history, from Bonnie Prince Charlie to "Lawrence of Arabia and "Dances with Wolves, as well as the Japanese-themed "Shogun, which is based on the life of Miura Anjin/William Adams.  Here, Tom Cruise is the stranger in a strange land, and the Samurai of Japan are the warrior culture.  Being no stranger to Samurai films of Japanese history, I was pleased by all aspects of "The Last Samurai.  Both the modernizing Meji government and the past-looking Samurai of the period are well represented, although the Samurai come out looking much better.  The warrior code of Bushido is not explained, and the lifestyle is completely romanticized, yet this is a movie and not a history text.  Emperor Meji is well-played, which surprised me.  He is neither hero nor villain.  And there are ninjas, which improves every film. In the vein of the big Hollywood epics, "The Last Samurai serves up healthy doses of sweeping score, beautiful vistas and Japan-landscape eye candy.  The country has rarely looked so beautiful, although I bet some technicians spent plenty of time computer-erasing the omni-present power lines.  The samurai armor,while not historically accurate, looks beautiful on film.  There are more than a few scenes that leap beautifully from a Kurosawa flick.  A great looking cast helps as well. To this day, Japan has difficulty rationalizing tradition and modernization, as can be seen in books such as "Dogs and Demons.  "The Last Samurai has some good lessons for modern Japan, and some good entertainment for us all.
 I'm not generally emotional in movies.  I can only remember ever crying for two - and this was certainly one of them.  In the last scenes, I was bawling.  This is not to say that the ending is sad, however, and I hope I won't give it away by saying it gave me a sort of peace. I must recommend this movie.  It's the best that I've seen this year.  One of my friends who hates when Americans usurp a role that should have been played by a person indigenous to the country the movie was set in refused to see it.  However, Tom Cruise does not and cannot steal the spotlight in this movie.  The spotlight is aptly directed at the true last samurai and the actors that play them (and do so excellently).  The Japanese locales that the movie is shot in are absolutely breathtaking - they reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's snapshots of China.  Also, for all you ladies out there who think this is a guy movie
 I don't like Tom Cruise but this movie is great. The story is  great
 Truly an excellent movie. Exemplification of the word "honor". Well worth watching. You'll walk away from it with a greater vision of life.  By the way, I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise but I'll wholeheartedly say he played his role magnificently.
 I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but I can't think of anyone else who could have done as well in this movie.  The additional segments about the making of the movie, Japanese culture, and the Samurai were also very good.
 This movie is in my must see collection. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but he plays his part well in this. Truly a must see - especially on a big screen.
 Okay, so I might like Tom Cruise more than your average person, but no one can say this movie was poorly done or that the acting was bad.  EXCELLENT movie!!
 Just a really well done movie. This has it all
 I love historical dramas, and this was a really wondrous story. Anyone who loves history will love this film. Tom Cruise was at his height in acting. All the Japanese actors were great. I'm ordering Shogun for the Japanese history.
 Though I'm not a huge fan of Cruise's, his acting's been getting better with age. The Last Samurai is a solid film that shows us cultural clashes between American ideals and Japanese philosophies in a truly enjoyable way. Definitely worth watching!
 This is a movie that is based in ancient japan and shows you the real way of the samurai. It was a time when old japan was being destroyed and the new japan was being born. It gives you a better understanding about that time period in japan. It really was a big part of history for japan. It just a great film.
 Well, I remember the first time I came across this film when my school decided to take the senior boys to the movie, I being one of them those days. 'Last Samurai'. I was absolutely tantalized by the direction, by the beautifull scenario of Japan in the 19th Century, the war, etc. This film unlike many other battle and war oriented films is very very different and its not just the war or the battle sequences that overwhelmes your mind completely., I emphasize that! its also the emotional bond between each charecter. Ken Wantanbe and Tom Cruise were excellent and yes 'Taka' the sweet and beautifull sister of Wantanbe, how could I ever forget her. I am glad I got the movie finally on a DVD. The dvd is the typical loaded dvd with lots of extra features and the documentries were very interesting indeed. Thank you Amazon.com once again. Would purchase from here again!
 This was a very important part of history that everyone should want to know, also important to see how the western civilization affected nations across the globe.
 I am not necessarily a Tom Cruise fan but I thought he did an outstanding job in this role.  I loved this movie.  It was well cast and written.
 I think that this is a great movie for my collection. I am not only a costumer here but also a Seller, and let me tell you this movie is a keeper no doubt. Great visuals and great story!
 The video/audio transfer has excellent quality like what I experienced from other WB blu-ray discs in addition to being an enjoyable movie.
 Although not a box-office hit and factually inaccurate, I love this movie and would definitely put it in my top 10 favorites of all time.  My wife just bought me a PS3 and I had to pick up a blu-ray disk to see the difference for myself.  With SO MANY terrible, terrible movies available on blu-ray (Flyboys, Stealth, and Reign of Fire - the movie i consider to be one of the worst of all time - just to name a few), I decided to pick this up even though I already owned it on DVD.  I had seen the movie in HD on DirecTV before, so there were no surprises regarding quality, but I was still really impressed when switching between this and the 480p picture produced by my DVD player.  The colors are much more vibrant, the clarity is remarkable and it serves to submerse you in a movie that was already great as it was.  As a huge fan of the movie as well as of HD picture quality, I was happy to pick this up at Best Buy for $25, but I probably wouldn't recommend getting this if you have it on DVD already unless you're a big fan.  Now, if they could just get the Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-Ray...
 I just read one review that said the HD-DVD looks just like the DVD. I don't know what kind of equipment this guy is using, but on my 57 Sony HDTV, the difference is remarkable. This was admittedly my first HD-DVD purchase (and if I'm not mistaken, one of the first movies to be released on HD-DVD), but I am very picky about audio and video quality. The opening scenes had me speechless when I saw how clear and vivid everything looked. I subscribe to Dish Network along with their HD package, and this movie even makes those beautiful HD channels seem like something is missing. (The reason being that satellite channels contain more compression artifacts than HD-DVD.)  If you're a fan of the movie and have an HD-DVD player, don't hesitate. It's incredible.
 As a teacher of the martial arts and more specifically Bushido. I try to instill a sense of morality in my students. Think what you will about tom Cruise (Love him or hate him) but his character is a good balance to the movie and helps mainstream an otherwise "foreign film even people I know that will not typically watch a martial arts film enjoy this one. Ken  Watanabe is the best as Katsumoto. They couldn't have picked anyone else. The sense of honor is timeless. The blood is minimal for a movie of this genre.
 Wow. This movie deserves so many awards I can't even think of enough.  This movie was the first movie to make me cry watching it.  This movie had to be the most inspirational movie I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, you have to see it.  Gladiator almost got me into tears at the end, but this movie finally did it.  If you liked Gladiator, you will love this movie, especially if you are interested in Oriental culture.
 When it first came out, i had no interest as i felt after learning of the story, that while tom cruise is a good action film actor, he didnt possess the depth of skill to pull off a film of this nature.  After catching pieces of it on cable, i decided to make an effort and watch it from beginning to end, and did so a second time.  I then bought it and watched it  again.  I became immersed in it more deeply each time, realizing that there is a great deal of subtlety and depth not obtainable from an initial viewing.  From the strength of the superb supporting characters, to the gradual changing of cruise's character, and the details of the time re-created so credibly by the filmmakers, this was an excellent film of substance, not traditionally done by hollywood.  While i have seen Dances with wolves, as others have complained about the lack of originality of the storyline, i feel that not to be completely accurate.  I also feel cruise's portrayal was more convincing than Costner's, and that this film is of equal power and effectiveness.  There are, like all films, weaknesses, such as the lack of exploration of the samurai's rejection of modernity, (a deleted scene on disc 2 touches upon this), and the dialogue can be a bit lacking, such as the exchange between katsumoto and the emperor as to how the situation should be handled, these are minor in the grand epic that is the last samurai.  Watch it with an open mind, and scrutinize the background/secondary characters, all of whom - especially ujio - were excellent.  And imho, it was a better picture than Return of the king, but than again, hollywood picked Titanic over LA Confidential for best picture, so who said hollywood is a place for the intelligent?
 What a great movie.  Acting is excellent, movie is suspensful and exciting, action is extrodinary.  I have to say i was so embarrased to see Tom Cruise in that ridiculous outfit on the preview.  When i saw it my mind completely changed though.  I honestly can't think of anything that would make the movie better.  The fights were brilliant, nothing looked even the slightest bit fake.  The story was excellent and exciting tell the end.  I really was not expecting much out of this other than some good fights but after seeing it i had to buy it the day it came out.  I loved everything about this movie and there is nothing i can critisize on.  Excellent movie, a must see.
 This movie has it all. Drama, action, amazing battle scenes - the best I've ever seen.  It's definitely a must see.
 I always was interested in the idea and ideals of the Samurai, but no one movie can envelope as much as this one. Others, like Ghost Dog
 "The Last Samurai was a story about a man who changes the way that he feels about a certain type of people in Japan. It stars Tom Cruise, but to me he was not the star of the film. I feel that the movie had most of its power from the supporting actor Ken Watanabe. The way that he acted throughout the movie could give him the Oscar in the Best Supporting Actor Catagory. The entire movie could win many different awards, and I'm glad that Tom Cruise was not nominated, because I have seen him in much better roles, like "Minority Report, or "Vanilla Sky. His great scene comes towards the end, where he gives emotion and power at once. Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero who loves to drink. He's recently come from battling American Indians in the west, and often had bad memories of what took place during those battles. But Algren gets a job when Japanese businessman Omura wants him to train the new army, with somebody that he knows Bagley. Bagley wants Algren because of the way that he battled the Indians. Algren agrees when he is able to bring his fellow Army fighter Sergeant Zebulon Gant. When they make it to Japan, they are met by the translator Simon Graham, and they begin to train the troops for battle. But Omura wants them to fight the samurai and their leader Katsumoto right away, and overrules Algren causing him to take his inexperienced troops to battle the Katsumoto. Algren is almost killed during the battle, but taken back to Katsumoto's village, which is ruled by his son. Algren is trapped, and there is no way for him to be able to return back to Japan. While with Katsumoto, he learns all about the way of the samurai and he finds out that there is nothing wrong with the people that Omura wants to kill. But it also becomes clear that Bagley is getting ready to fight. Algren befriends Katsumoto, and the two learn that they have much more in common then they oringally thought, and it becomes clear to Algren what he must do. "The Last Samurai was a beautiful film. It had a beautiful sceney, beautiful action, some beautiful acting, and beautiful direction. I really did love it, and I am including it on the best of 2004, only beause I saw it at the very beginning of this year. This is one of those movies that you have to see in the theatre, otherwise it is not going to be an good. It is a big screen movie, and I have a feeling that I would have been disappointed if I saw it on video first. Try and see it now, before it totally disappears. ENJOY! Rated R for strong violence and battle sequences.
 The way of Samurai is the way of Death. I think Tom Cruise really understood that and he can die happy now. See the film and think about your death - will it be so beautiful and meaningful as the death of Katzumoto? The film
 This is movie is so great. I am really dissappointed that Tom Cruise wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his wonderful acting. He does such a good job to make us feel for his character and care about what happens to him and the samurai. The action is wonderful and there is no unnecessary romantic scenes like it seems many movies do these days. It is such a wonderful movie for the whole family and it's dissappointing to see that it wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Watch this movie, and if you've already seen it, watch it again!!!
 What a rush! This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very very long time. I will not bother giving a synopses for the movie, but I will tell you what I loved. The movie has a great theme, that of a man seeking to atone for his sins. In the end, he finds the means to forgive himself through the help of another man, Kasamoto and his culture. Granted, there are several historial inaccurate items, but that does not stop this from being a great and enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise name might get first billing for this movie, but Ken Watanabe steals the show as the honourable Kasamoto. He has rightly been honoured with a Academy Awards nomination. If anything, watch the movie for him!
 "The Last Samurai is BY-FAR - without a doubt - THE BEST MOVIE EVER in the history of movie-making! Returns us to the classics! They don't make them like this anymore! A MUST-SEE! AND a MUST-sweep for the Oscars, the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild, and the remainder of the awards season! Tom Cruise (Captain Nathan Algren) gives the best performance of his career! And Ken Watanabe (Lord Katsumoto) and Koyuki (Taka) give OUTSTANDING supporting performaces! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!! My favorite movie of ALL TIME!
 If you don't already know the whole story of this great film, let me tell you what you need to know about it. It is story about regaining self respect. Everyone deals with demons in their past, if you would like to see a film that is exceptionally well acted, and beautifully filmed set in 19th century Japan, that deals with overcoming past mistakes this is  a film you will love. If you do, you will really love the book <a href="http
 It is rare that movies with historical perspectives can capture all three sides of a conflict so accurately.  As anyone who's studied Japanese history can tell you, the conflict herein was almost perfectly portrayed on all levels; within the government, within the characters, and within the nation (Japan) as a whole.  Set in the 1890's when Japan's emperor Meiji was trying desperately to "modernize (read "westernize") Japan, we get to see an American's perspective on the wars that are ravaging the old nation of Japan.  While many Japanese people were trying so hard to be fashionable and up to date, there were a great many who felt that the country was being robbed of it's heritage and the ideals that were so strongly ingrained in the people as a whole were being tossed to the side all in the name of "catching up with the rest of the world.  It's tragic to watch as the young emperor is manipulated by his advisors into betraying the one man whom he should have listened to all along; his former teacher and mentor Katsumoto.  During all of this, however, Tom Cruise is thrown into the mix as Nathan Algren, a retired Civil War hero who won acclaim for himself for massacreing the plains indians in the Nazi-esque style of the time ("I was just following orders at the time, sir").  Upon his arrival in Japan, his desperation for the sweet abyss of death is just out of reach time and again, but it is his capture by the "enemy where he finds his redemption.  Some people who have reviewed this film refuse to see the Samurai as anything but bloodthirsty and savage (much like too many people saw the Native Americans), which couldn't be farther from the truth.  A peaceful people by nature, but stoic and steadfast in their beliefs of honor and discipline (two words that are unfortunately lost on most Americans these days), the Samurai sought only to keep their country pure from foreign influence (a noble cause, if a bit misplaced and/or closed-minded) out of fear that their own way of life would go the way of the Indian (which it did anyway), and herein lies the true power of this film.  From the beginning of the film, anyone with any knowledge of Japanese history (or even of modern Japan) knows that the Samurai are ultimately doomed to die.  I knew this going in, but found that this movie kindled a hope in me that they could ultimately win and save their country from itself as the samurai way saved Algren (Tom Cruise) from himself.  While Algren succeeds, he and his cause ultimately fail and the emperor realizes this only too late as too much has already been set in motion due to the machinations of his scheming advisors who are only in it to line their own pockets (which is totally historically accurate; the merchant class saw in "westernization a way to finally grow in social stature and the Samurai were standing in their way, so they used their newfound wealth and influence to eradicate the Samurai).  Doomed from the beginning, this film is more about one man's triumph over his own demons than it is about a country falling apart.  Set against the backdrop of the Meiji "restoration"-era civil wars, there's no way this film doesn't succeed (except, perhaps, for the romantic interest which was unecessary but not to the point that it detracted anything from the film).  We root for the hero to overcome his own personal obstacles while watching him fight a losing battle against a place and time that ultimately implodes upon itself.  And while he comes out on top, and stronger for it, he is now  alone in his new world because those who got him to it have been slaughtered around him.  All in all, the movie is tragic yet uplifting at the same time.  It IS historically accurate (no matter what anybody tells you, take it from someone who used to live in Japan and has studied Japanese history for 13 years), it is worth watching, and it was far more oscar-worthy than that abortion of a film about Japan "Lost in Translation. Wow, what a movie! First of all, the story line is so intersting. It is around 1876 and Japan is on course to introduce western lifestyle in the country. However, the Samurais, the traditional Japanese warriors they do not want to except this novice. Thus emperor of Japan confront them military. In order to train the Japanese military the US army captain (portrayed by Tom Cruise) is invited. During one of the confrontations he is taken as a prisoner by Samurais. He spends in Samurai village several month. He studies their lifestyle, their traditions and realizes that he was on the wrong side of the battlefield. Thus he decides to stand next to the Samurais and fight with them for their freedom.  This is an epic movie. It probably can be compared to "Braveheart". Tom Cruise is brilliant, his acting is amazing. This is must have for movie lovers. I still do not believe that Oscar committee prefered "The Lord of the Rings to "The Last Samurai". This is really dissapointing.
 I loved the movie myself. Great camera work, nice action scenes, and alot of drama. I think many people would benefit from watching the old 70's movie Shogun.  I think Cruise did a fine job. Was he "striving for an Oscar"? Don't know. Don't care. Why not let the movie and actors stand for themselves? Does he have the same personality in all his movies? Well, yah, sorta. But I'm sorry so do most actors that people think are great. I love Anthony Hopkins myself, but he always seems the same. The only actor (another that I love) I can think of off the top of my head that is actually different in some of his movies is Gary Oldman and that's stretching it a bit.  I liked the relationship between Cruise and the people of the village. He saw them as savages, and they saw him the same way. The "relationship with his hostess didn't seem strained to me. She hated him because he was an unwashed savage that killed her husband, but as time progressed, no one could deny his trying not only to fit in but to not back down (which is something they would appreciate). And, he got on well with her kids. Call me chauvanistic here, but any man that is good with a woman's kids will hit a soft spot. And, there was no "Take me, Cruise!!! scene at all in the movie. I don't see the problem. Also, he never was samurai. He appreciated their culture but admittedly didn't understand alot of it which is... understandable.  As to the final part of the movie being overly done hollywood... I think SOMEONE had to survive. Someone had to bring this to the emperor's face and show it in a personal way. When you think about it, Algren was the only option for this. Was it cliche'? Sure. But, had it just ended with them all dying, there would have been no resolution. Perhaps had the emperor been there to see it... then I would say you could just leave it at all the men dying and the emperor being moved by it, but he wasn't. So, someone had to bring this to him. It couldn't be Katsumoto, because he (and his sword) was the message itself. It couldn't have been the other samurai, because to do such a thing would have been not their place and disrespectful (culture gaps here). The only person who could to this, and get away with it, was Algren. He was NOT a samurai (and don't be confused into thinking  The Last Samurai referred to him, because it didn't. It referred to Katsumoto.), AND he represented a third party perspective. That was the clincher. The act moved an "honorless white man (culture gap again) to come before the emperor and even offer to end his life in some accordance to the Bushido code. It WAS moving.  And it wasn't saying that by becoming "modernized the Japanese were doing wrong (as a reviewer put it). It was attempting to demonstrate and correct the attitude
 I rated The Last Samurai 5 stars because it was the best movie i have ever seen. It's got it all mad good action, a little comedy, and some romance. I don't really like romance but with the girl that plays Katsamoto's sister. She is really hot. And I liked the movie so much I went to go see it again. I can't get enuff of it. I am going to see it again. So go see The Last Samurai I garntee you will love it.(.)(.)
 I was able to catch a sneak preview of this movie. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It has action, humor, and lots of emotional moments. I don't have time for details. This is a movie that should not be missed! Forget Master and Commander and Timeline, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
 When I saw this film at the theaters, I remember enjoying it but not thinking much of it.  Now, years later, I watched it again, and I was so pleasantly surprised. The story is very dramatic, it's beautifully photographed, and the action is breathtaking. The performances across the board are great, including what I consider a career best from Tom Cruise.  It's just really good. If you like historical dramas like Gladiator, Braveheart, or Dances with Wolves, you should really enjoy this. It's definitely in the same league.
 Not 100% FACTUAL but a great movie with a wonderful view of changing cultural upheaval and the clash of traditional with technological
 I love this movie. It is one of the best with Tom cruise. This is one that will watch more than once.
 I owned this movie before & it was stolen from my house. I was determined that I would not buy it again, but it was such a good movie I had to give in. The real reason for this review is the fast dependable service provided by Amazon. I ordered this movie & had it in my mailbox two days later. Thank you Amazon, you never let me down.
 The film itself is great now that i saw it on blu-ray its just amazing.
 My brother thinks of this as one of the best movies ever.  I thought it was pretty good, but I sent it to him for a what the heck gift, and it was worth it to make him happy.
 Well we already know about the movie so i am not going to comment on it. The most noticable thing about this Blu Ray release is the picture quality, its sharp, vivid colors, simply amazing. 
 This movie held my attention all the way through. It has a lot of action, but it was well-paced, believable, and well-intertwined with great drama and cinematography. The similarities this movie has with Dances with Wolves is intellectually stimulating and welcomes thoughtful discussion. I think I will add this DVD to my collection.
 I was captured by the strong similarities between Samuari culture and Native Americans back in the day.  The use of horses, bow and arrow, weaving, agricultural lifestyle, respect and honor.  Portrayed romanticized life of Samurai with great action scenes and beautiful cinematography. This movie was easy to enjoy.  No serious criticisms about the movie since it was meant for pure entertainment.  Perhaps there were historical inaccuracies.....but its message was clear
 I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I love this film.  I liked the story, the Japanese actors, the costumes and scenery.  I've watched this film several times, and I've cried everytime.
 Music, grandeur, great locales--everything!  Battle scenes are amazing.  Bought fullscreen edition and it fills big screen HDTV with vivid picture.  Extra disc has fascinating stuff.
 I am a high school student that is in love with the samurai.  This movie after I saw it made me get back into the martial arts which I had quit over a decade earlier and now I am a assistant instructor.  This movie is both historical correct on the sense of the last samurai killed himself.  There was no Tom Cruise character but that was based on James Clavells Shogun.  This movie is about a American veteran that has lost his will to live after some mishaps that he had when facing the american indians in the 1860's.  He gets recruited by the Japanese Shogun to train a modern army after Closed Door policy that had lasted for over two hundred years.  The samurai are revolting because of the change and the Western nations changing Japan.  Tom Cruise gets a new outlook on life when he meets the samurai and finds something he loves.  This movie had me in tears b/c of the history and emotion that was put into this movie.  A must see film and a must buy film.
 Many people say that Tom Cruse is unconvincing or overrated. I am now convinced that these people have seen neither this film or Collateral. This is a heart-felt, pure epic of sorts which are very rare in this day and age. This film follows a sad storyline of fighting for tradition and avoiding judging anyone until you meet them. This movie is filled with breath-taking scenary of the Japanese landscapes, and riveting battle sequences. Films of this caliber are very rare.  *9* (A)
 This movie was a masterpiece. I felt it should have deserved more credit for what it received. One of Tom Cruise's best performances of all-time. A GREAT story that was well told of a long forgotten group of warriors in Japan who fought and served with honor, excellence, and discipline with a purpose. Their duty lies in their name - Samurai=to serve. The most sophisticated warrior of its time. The scenes shot in the movie were picture perfect and awe-inspiring for admirers of Japanese culture and Japanese history. A story of West meets (Far)East. Tom Cruise's ignorant, cocky, character from the West leads to a humbling experience when he learns to live with the Samurai and understand their way of life. He reveals that they were not a barbaric people but instead a sophisticated society that lived in discipline. Opposite of what the West had perceived of the Samurai image. I recommend anyone to this movie and if you didnt know it will open up a new perception of a people who lived long ago.
 After seeing all of the movies nominated for Best Picture 2003, and just watching The Last Samurai last night, I feel that this movie (not to mention its actors)was greatly overlooked by the Academy. Cruise is spectacular as the disillusioned 7th Cavalry Captain who finds his place among Katsumoto's (Ken Watanabe..who should have won an Oscar as well)rebel band of samurai's who are fighting to keep their tradition alive in a time when Japan is looking to become more westernized. This movie has a little bit of something in it for everyone and I highly recommend it...
 The Last Samurai is an inspiring, artistic, touching movie. It even manages to stay pretty close to the historical facts it's based on.  The premise of the movie is anything but new, even so, it's a unique production. It offers insight into the japanese culture and we, the audience, take it in through the senses of the main character, Nathan Allgren [Tom Cruise]. We learn about the samurai, honor, trust, pursuit of perfection and harmony, discipline and tradition, all adjectives that make Japan what it is today.  There are a couple of things however that I personally would have liked to have seen changed. A bit more action and a bit less philosophy and talk [less gab, more shooting one might say].  The last scenes of the movie could have definitely done well without the typical hollywood dramatic dialogue and action. It was a bit over the top compared to the rest of the movie which was realistic and down-to-earth.  Almost forgot to mention the movie's soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant, the tracks are a combination of japanese traditional music and western music. Beautiful.  All in all, I absolutely loved this movie and is now part of my DVD collection. It's one of the few titles I would enjoy watching again once in a while.
 I gave 5 stars to this movie and also to Tom Cruise's performance. It's one of the most powerful Hollywood epic dramas. I also am impressed by the great acting of the supporting cast, such as Katsumoto's son. His performance was very good indeed. When Tom Cruise was captured in his village, we saw a kind, innocent and pure boy. When he was helping his father to escape, he became brave and determined. I was sad to see him fighting to his death. The diverse sides of this young man were well handled by the actor. You won't forget this movie after you watch it. I truely think Tom Cruise is a great actor. His acting is getting better and better, unlike some actors/actresses who never improve themselves but merely depend on their good looks. Conclusion
 I rank this movie right up there with Braveheart and Gladiator as far as epics go. At first I thought this was going to be one of those "face time movies just to get a paycheck for Tom Cruise, but to my suprise it was a great movie. While watching this movie I actually learned something, which I wasn't expecting, and that was that the samurai were alot like the native americans in the ways that they were removed from their own land.This is one of the best movies to come out in the last couple of years and a breath of fresh air compared to those movies like Master and Commander that claimed to be action movies but were really just "face time for their leading man.
 wow, this movie was great... im serious, everyone should watch this movie. it was brilliant. It's about Tom Cruise, he starts to train a Japanese army and then during a battle between his troop and the saumrai he killed a samurai and then he is taken prisoner with the samurai but they are kind to him and stuff. well eventually, he makes friends and what not with the samurai and he goes to battle on their side. i cryed so hard in so many parts of the movie. it was just so beautiful. and i laughed at some of tom's lines. he really isnt such a bad actor nd this is by far his best movie yet. and the action scenes (being a tru fan of patriot,braveheart, and saving private ryan) were filmed really well.  it's true, this may not depicted what it was really like but i dont know why so many people are criticizing this movie. alot of people are saying its an insult to japanese to think that an american is the last samurai after a little while of learning. calm down! my best friend is asain and she cryed and loved the movie! it was not insulting to her nor her mother! i wouldnt mindif americans were wiped out in battle and the only one left was an asain who adopted western ways. i'd be proud that soeone survived and passed on the legacy of my people. that whole idea is a bunch of racist crap and stop overreacting!!!! i didnt think the movie was slow either. every part was beautiful and filled with depth and emotion. there was no way the editor could delete ANY scenes that were in the finished product because they were all necessary and lets face it... BRILLIANT! and alot of people are saying the characters werent well developed but cant u see
 A lot of people (myself, included) were skeptical when this movie was released. "Ok, a white guy (let alone Tom Cruise) playing the "Last Samurai"!?  Yeah right! was the general consensus.  After watching this movie, though, you'll see that it's an homage to the Japanese culture, and Tom is merely there as an outside observer to show the culture shock that happens when he's introduced to their, very different, way of life.  As far as the HD-DVD transfer goes, the movie never looked better!  I have a home theater (my screen is over 9 feet wide!) so I need HD, otherwise images look just "ok", as opposed to "spectacular", the way this movie does.  Highly recommended if you're a fan of the Japanese culture or Tom Cruise.  And if you're a fan of Ken Watanabe then this movie is a MUST HAVE, because his role and his acting job are superb (as usual)!
 I purchased this video for my teenage son. He has watched it several times, and says he would recommend it to anyone that likes these types of movies.
 When I first heard about this movie I was sceptical. I was afraid that a Samurai movie starring a white guy might end up kind of goofy. But Tom Cruise puts in a strong performance here and won me over by the end of the film. If you love swords this is the movie for you. Tons of training with swords, fighting with swords, and philosiphising about them. The action is spectacular, and the score is stirring. The cinemtography is beautiful. The mountain village reminded me of the shire and made me want to live there. For a movie with some brutally violent action sequences, it also features some amazingly peaceful and relaxing moments in the middle of the film. Anyone who believes in honor and chivalry will find this movie inspiring.  Est Sularus Oth Mithas!
 It's unfortunate that some people dont see the true beauty of this film, like me if you are a anime fan you should see it. The last samurai is great from beginning to end the fight scenes were great and the story and plot was so perfect it's almost unbelievable. Even though the story is fake the families involved and the events that make this story come to life are all historic facts.These men died in battle and even know they died they died to get their point across and to be heard when they needed to be heard the most. It was a fight that couldn't be won but to these men it was either fight  and die proud  or run and you would be forced to kill yourself and die a coward, they died and the rest of their family lived to fight another day.Tom cruse did a great job in this movie but the awards should go to Ken watanabe or Katsumoto and the other men/samurai who made this movie great. To end this some peolple need to be told that before watching this movie dont mistake it for a fraud because some people expect Tom cruse to be the last samurai and seeing that he is not of japanese descent that might bother some people and it's nothing like that because I judged this movie before seeing it and I was dead wrong and suprised at what saw and loved this movie.
 (4.5 Stars) I have noticed the people that didn't give this movie good ratings were more or less history buffs or are really into studying ancient Japan.  I myself enjoyed this movie alot, although I do have to say it reminds me, in principle, of dances with wolves.  White man is hired to destroy foreign culture, white man falls in love with culture, white man fights on the side of the culture he was supposed to destroy....same plot essentially right?  With that said, the action scenes are entertaining and I found the character development between the samurai and cruise to be pretty good.  Even though I generalized it like that it is still a really good movie...but that's only my opinion.
 I loved every minute of this movie.  In some ways though I love the ending the most.  I know a lot of people were pissed off by it, but here's how I look at it.  You have to listen to the narration--no one knows what really happened.  That final scene--in my opinion--is only what the british linguist wants to believe happened to his friend.  As for Tom Cruise surviving, well again the narration points out that many people think he died of his injuries.  He may have made it off that battle field, but he didn't do it easily.  Also, somone pointed out that if he really believed the Samuri code he would have killed himself.  A) I think he owed it to Katsumoto to bring the Emperor his sword, and tell the emperor what took place.  The whole point of that battle was to send a message to the emperor, and it was a message that needed at least one person to drive it home.  B)Anyone who thinks he should have just killed himself misses the fact that he isn't samuri.  He's a melding of two cultures.  Even after all he'd been through, I think that remains true.
 I cannot say enough good things about this movie so I will try to keep it short. Set in 19th century Japan a single group of samurai is all that is left of a once fearsome and noble tradition, and Tom Cruise ends up staying with them. I do not want to say much more about the story, unlike some other reviewers, because it is impossible to tell as well as the film does. I will just say that this epic and beautfully written tale leaves you with a whole new respect for what samurais have done for the legend of Japan.    Tom Cruise is simply phenomenal! This is his best performance on the silver screen by far. Also, his co-star Ken Watanabe who plays the leader of the samurai is better than your highest expectaions. As for the fighting, there are many great scenes that range from sword training to being raided by ninjas to the final bloody battle that can stand up to any other ever filmed.  Speaking of blood, the special effects are outstanding and the sound is excellent, they really bring the action to life.  The anamorphic widescreen format is the icing on the cake.  Packed with incredible fights and battles, breathtaking cinematography, and violence up the yin-yang(I know that is chinese) The Last Samurai is a must have for any movie fan!
 The degree to which I loved this film was really surprising.  It is a film of epic proportions.  The viewer is treated to a slice of historical fiction that, thanks to the second accompanying DVD, examines the degree the filmmakers qwent to guarantee the accuracy of the time period through the actors, the scenary, the costumes and more.   This movie is about a used up war Captain down on his luck who gets the opportunity to make a good deal of money by selling what he has left to offer - that being his lifetime of warring, of making war and of studying war.  He is perpetually haunted by the memories of his time serving under General Custer when he was ordered to murder innocent Native Americans, women and children, who he knew were innocent at the time they were slaughtered.  He became an alcoholic.  So the Captain is provided with this opportunity to go to Japan and train the newly developing Japanese army with the intention of defeating the old Samarai warriors who have been the protectors of the Japanese people for over 1000 years.  The young Emperer is being pushed into the modern times.  As a result, the Captain becomes exposed to the ways of the Samarai.  The story is absolutely captivating.   Though I usualy don't do this, I watched the accompanying DVD with the special features.  I was glad I did because throughout the film I reflected back on what I saw and heard.  During the first 15 minutes I didn't think I'd like the film and I also had a hard time dealing with Tom Cruise as the Captain, but I knew shortly thereafter that I would be purchasing the movie on DVD.  There's just so much to see in this film and from so many different aspects that I want to be able to own and watch this movie whenever I'd want as well as share and encourage my friends and family to see it as well.
 THE LAST SAMURAI starring Tom Cruise has been compared far too much to DANCES WITH WOLVES as though, somehow, what we have here is a reversal of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  Let's just look at the movie for its own sake and forget the nonsense about comparisons to other flicks, especially DANCES WITH WOLVES. THE LAST SAMURAI is simply a beautiful story about a man who is able to see the best in his  enemies.   Taken prisoner, he is forced to study a culture that is based on honor and simplicity and determines to defend  what he has come to love.  The movie goes a long way in portraying the end of feudal Japan and accurately depicts a culture bound by spiritual beliefs that permeated everything from the way tea was served to how a warrior honorably ended his own life.  And all without the ridiculous and unnecessary political correctness that saturated DANCES WITH WOLVES! If you watch and enjoy this movie for nothing more than the beauty of Japan and the wonderful way that the makers of this movie put it on the screen you will be richly rewarded.  Supporting Cruise, Ken Watanabe is superb in his role as the Samurai chieftain, Katsumoto, and Hiroyuki Sanada is a scene-stealer as Cruise's antagonistic enemy, Ujio, turned reluctant but effective teacher and mentor.
 This movie is about the honor of a disappearing culture falling to the ever enchroaching imperial world in both 19th Century America and Europe.  It is about the Samurai who are no longer needed in a Westernized Japan and symbolizes the culture of Japan as it is swallowed up by Western Imperialism in the 19th Century. The movie centers around Captain Algren (Tom Cruise), an ex-American Civil War soldier and Indian fighter who has lost his honor and is disillusioned about the world he lives in.  Tom Cruise is great in this role and is quite possibily his best role yet.  Algren is sent to Japan by America to train the Imperial Japanese army in the way of Western warfare and weaponry.  This sets up the confrontation between the Samurai, who are defending their dying culture, and Algren, who is trying to destroy that culture.  Algren is captured by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the Samurai leader, in the battle.  While in capitivity, Algren learns the way of the Samurai and comes to respect the dying culture. Many people say this is just a rip off of Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves.  It isn't.  This is a vastly different storyline with a similiar idea that can be seen in Dances With Wolves.  The two are different stories. The production values of this movie are great and well directed by Edward Zwick (Glory).  Definitely the a great directed movie.  My hat is off to the crew that made this happen. Yes, there are historical accuracies in the film, but besides Gods and Generals and Gettysburg, how many films are historical accurate?  Not many and if they were they would probably be rather boring to many.  On this DVD is a documentary about the true story of the Last Samurai by the History Channel.  So if you are worried about historical inaccuracies then you can get the real tale in the documentary on the special features disc. All in all a great movie about a dying culture and how some people won't simple [surrender] themself to save their life and lose their culture.
 A very well crafted movie, with so many parallels to the spiritual life, especially the priesthood. I was particularly struck by its romantic view of an idealized lost culture, juxtaposed against modern industry and greedy politicians, which served as a warning against the dangers of Utilitarianism (which pope John Paul II spent so much time speaking out against in his writings).
 One of my all time favorites. Arrived early in great condition. It was wonderful to see it in HD. I have it on DVD but it was a great deal.
 Bargain deal at a great price. Bought it during Black Friday at amazing low price with super saver shipping! Packaging is fine.

 Movie was easy to find online.  It arrived as promised and I'm happy with the order and the way it was processed.  I'll order from this company again.
 I'm happy with the service, especially the package and the protection of this item. The movie have very good quality image and sound. I will recommend to my friend and family
 Nathan Algren (played by Tom Cruise) is a troubled alcoholic who is fast approaching self-destruction, following the North American Indian Wars.  Down and nearly out, Algren is approached by members of his former cavalry unit to help train the emerging Japanese military.  At first Algren is driven by the opportunity to make a quick and substantial dollar in Japan, yet it is when he is left for dead that he begins the process of healing himself, whilst held in captivity.  The film provides a sample of a Japan that has newly opened itself to the Western World, with tradition and new ways having an uneasy relationship.  It is possibly one of Cruise's best performances of the 2000's, and the movie narrative is rich with action and meaningful story.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
 I always wanted to see this movie, and I wasn't disappointed.  It was a wonderful DVD!!  It arrived in pristine condition.
 Great Quality DVD, clean, no scratches. Came quite quickly. Came with everything as promised and in perfect condition! NO complaints here!
 It was a quick send It was a great product I would buy from againnn
 This movie is one of the best movie every time you see it... you learn somthing new.
 I have seen the film in theaters and about a hundred times on DVD. I beleive it to be the very best film on dvd. Ps. HEY DUDE WHO WROTE THAT SAMURAI IS INNCORECT AND BUSHI IS CORRECT IS WRONG, BUSHI WAS THE SAMURAI'S NAME BEFORE THEY WENT INTO SERVICE OF THE EMPEROR, SAMURAI "TO SERVE MEANS TO SERVE THE EMPEROR, READ UP ON YOUR HISTORY BEFORE MAKING SUCH ALIGATIONS.  ANYWAYS best dang movie of all time 5 out of 5.
 The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It was a blockbuster smash in Japan.  It tells the story of the Samurai of Japan and how they became obsolete due to westernization of their country.  Although the last scene with the emperor concerning his decision whether to fully open Japan to the West is pure fiction, the rest is generally accurate.  The director seeks to romanticize the samurai.  The samurai traditions and culture are not that difficult to romanticize.  Everything they stood for is portrayed in the film.  Watching it, you yearn to add these values to your own life, and feel achingly their loss to today's society.  This is the true value of the film - to raise the samurai once again, in their full glory of life, and the strange glory of their deaths. The climactic scene of the final battle between the samurai and the new army is predictable, yet still horrifying.  You just wish it could end differently.  Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are glorious.  Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  I feel The Last Samurai should have received more nominations, and at least one Oscar. In real life, the last of the samurai did indeed perish in a last-stand battle against the new military.  They were led by a samurai general who died in the battle.  He is now a hero in Japanese legend and culture.
 I am not especially a big Tom Cruise fan but this was an EXCEPTIONAL Film.  I can see that a lot of time and effort went into the making of this wonderful film.  This action packed film keeps you on the edge of your seat and will also tear at your heart. It is a must have for all serious film buffs and dvd collectors.  I will watch this film again and again.
 For those who enjoy the book SHOGUN by James Clavell, sit back for a true treat.  The story, though not new, is very tightly woven.  From the epic scenery of Japan(wow!) to the battles scenes(double wow!), this movie shows nothing but grace througout it's 2 1/2 hours.  The romance was refreshing and beautiful as there are no nudity or sexual scenes that hollywood soo depends on to get ratings(or points across).  How powerful it is to just see plain human emotion show by one's ever so slight movement and gestures.  Incredible.  The Asian actors, Ken Watanabe, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Koyuki(gorgeous in all graceful forms) all deserve nominations as I rarely see such inspiring performances.  Everything you'd expect in a grand adventure from director Edward Zweck.  The music by Hans Zimmer is truly deserving.  Though not as "Japanese as some reviewers stated, I truly felt heart motivated through his symphonic composition for the battle scenes.  I'm sorry, should I instead state "awe inspired"!  So sit back, relax and enjoy something that only comes out once in awhile.  If you like this, perhaps you'll also enjoy a Japanese animation that's called "samurai X
 The guys wrote a lot of good stuff in other reviews and i'm not gonna add any more except my HIGH appreciation and recommendations to this movie. I watched twice in the cinema, and finally i go the DVD and watched it again. To me, this is the best movie for Tom Cruise. And it will be a while till he can do something that is better than this one. Again, This is PERFECT. It deserves the 5 stars without hesitating. regards
 "The Last Samarai is one of the greatest films released in 2003, starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe.  Its hardhitting impact is intense enough to keep audiences' eyes wide open through the whole movie.  Its written plot of a US soldier changing his life for the better in Japan is brilliant.  Despite the war themes, there are some great heartwarming scenes, namely when the US soldier starts healing his pains from his US war battles.  As he begins learning Japanese traditions, he begins learning more about himself, which plays a crutial part in the film.  As this develops, the drama also develops, which keeps audiences interested.  This allows the conflicts between the two sides to be brought out as brilliantly as it was.  His friends' life stories add an additional unique flavor.  The war scenes are uniquely intense.  Few other movies have thought of such original war scenery.  This teaches audiences that there is no one way to fight a war or to solve a conflict.  Its Oscar-nominated 1870's Japanese setting is flawless.  They prove that they did their research to construct such an elaborate set.  The war scenes are desplicted as brutal as they should thanks to the special effects.  The costumes are accurate from those times.  Such great background offers an improved sense of this masterpiece film. Tom Cruise's underrated role as US soldier Nathan Algren is his best in years.  His two years of training to prepare for his role paid off.  He never loses his intense sense of emotion for a second.  The pain and agony expressed are as pure as if he actually lived it.  Ken Watanabe's Oscar-nominated role as Samarai leader Katsumoto rightfully places him in the spotlight.  This performance makes acting appear easy when it's actually the opposite.  He proves that he will become a big-name actor in the next following years.  All other actors also performed their roles beautifully. "The Last Samarai is great for those looking for a unique war movie with emotion.  This is sure to please many audiences.  This is destined to be a classic in the following years as it deserves.
 &#65533;The path to enlightenment is littered with the bodies of the ignorant.&#65533; This movie was simply incredible.  The acting second to none, the story moving and flawless, the characters deep and passionate, a must see, again and again. Hired to train the army of a Japan drowning in western influence, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), becomes captured by a band of &#65533;savage&#65533; samurai warriors led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). In the months to come Algren embraces the code of the samurai and befriending his &#65533;savage&#65533; enemies to soon discover there is nothing savage about honor, duty, and respect.
 After reading some of the reviews here, I was not expecting too much from this movie, but thought I would give it a try anyway. I was truly surprised, it was VERY well done, the acting and story line were far more solid then I had expected. This movie delievered far more then I expected.  So all I really have to say, is give this movie a try, I doubt you will be disapointed.
 Although I generally eschew movies with battles and lots of warfare, and had to be convinced by my husband to see this, I was amazed at how wonderful this movie was.   There were no cheesy moments in this film.  There were no gratuitous gore, violence, or nudity.  No sex, just the gentle suggestion of what could happen at some other date.  It was fabulously done.  Fully believable, and very in tune with the Japanese culture that I was exposed to while living there. Clearly a previous reviewer didn't watch the film carefully.  The main character was never officially made a samurai; however, he was exposed to eastern philosophies in a gentle, very authentic, eastern philosophy way.  The main character learned about mindlessness, mindfulness, and other tennants of Buddhism, but overall the main theme of this epic was HONOR.  Honor in living, honor in battle, and honor in death.   Young teens and older children could watch this field, because it lacks the graphic violence and sexuality as I mentioned before.  I am the mother of a 12 and 15-year-old, and I will show it to them  with no hesitation.
 Honor.  Integrity.  Loyalty.  And Bushido (translated to, "way of the warrior").  What place do these hold in life and all it encompasses.  Warner Bros. "The Last Samurai attempts to depict the epic and time age tale of traditional norms versus a new and modernizing society. The story takes place in Japan.  However, not Japan as we know it today, but just as it was emerging from its bloody, feudal cradle.  A feudal bloodbath entailing Japanese ways of life no more than 150 years ago. "The Last Samurai begins with a Japanese empirical advisor who needs the samurai eliminated in order to finish his railroad.  At first the samurai are viewed as imperial rebeliests; "barbarians with no sense of what is right and wrong.  The advisor hires an American Civil War veteran, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and for $500 a month he trains a small army of men to fight the samurai.  But when the samurai attack a railroad construction village the advisor becomes impatient and orders Cruise's superior officer Colonel Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) to lead the small and unprepared force against the samurai.  The skilled and experienced samurai easily overpower the unpolished army and take Cruise as their prisoner.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the group leader of the samurai, along with other agendas, wishes to "know his enemy. Cruise eventually grows to love the simplicity and stillness of the samurai way of life.  He adopts the concept of Bushido (Japanese for "way of the warrior"); a theme that flows compassionately throughout the film.  Over the course of a year he learns samurai ways, their fighting methods, and even eventually begins to learn their language. But when his new found life is threatened by the old, he chooses to fight with the men he once considered his enemy. Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a downtrodden Civil War veteran who douses his troubles in alcohol.  He suffers from flashbacks that give Cruise's character a sense of shame and weariness.  And while Cruise's performance is exceptional even he cannot take precedence over the grandeur and scope of what "The Last Samurai does symbolize.  The death of an era, and the usherance of technological assimilation. Asian actors Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), and Koyuki (Taka), play their roles brilliantly; and while their dialogue is not as numerous as Cruise's, their actions speak for more than themselves.  Katsumoto, is a proud, thoughtful, and an integrible samurai leader.  For more than 900 years he and his ancestors have protected the ways and honor of his people.  He and Cruise periodically converse in philosophical meetings sprinkled with humor.  Taka shines as Cruise's caretaker.  However, very early in the movie we find out that Taka is a widow of a samurai that Cruise has killed in battle; an enigma that lends a sense of depth and responsibility to both characters roles throughout the movie. Perhaps one of the more historical points is the weakness of the Japanese Emperor, Meiji, played by Scichinosuke Nakamura.  At this point of Japan's history, the Emperor became more of a figurehead, controlled by a group of economist advisors only wishing to fatten their wallets.  But this is portrayed in more of a symbolic matter throughout "The Last Samurai. Both the complexity and simplicity of "The Last Samurai, enjoy ubiquity throughout the film.  There is never a moment in which both must not be weighed equally.  With every scene there is a sense of duty and honor, while there is at the same time enjoyment in the stillness of life.  A concoction of artsy filmography and articulating background music allow the plot to encompass all aspects of the movie; never will a moment take precedence over the plot or all that it strives to facilitate.  The facts of the matter are perhaps best but in a quote from the movie
 "The Last Samurai is one of this year's best movies! It is brilliant and poignant, with emotional and brilliant performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast. Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who is conflicted by the past by a very serious incident that happened during the Civil War. He is offered a job in Japan, where he is going to train the emperor's soldiers. But, when they are pulled into combat early, that is when during the soldiers' first attack that Algren is captured by the Samurai and kept alive by Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. That he is where he learns about his enemy and gets enlightened by them and decides to stay with them. Timothy Spall plays Simon Graham, a translator and photographer who is with Algren in this magnificent journey. Billy Connolly plays Zebulon Gant, a dear friend of Algren. Tony Goldwyn plays Colonel Bagley, a comrade and enemy of Algren's. This is a brilliant movie with a powerful story and a powerful word about how you look at things and you think at what they should be. Edward Zwick's directing is brilliant. The costume design by Ngila Dickson is splendid. The production design by Lilly Kilvert is incredibly beautiful. The film editing by Steven Rosenblum and Victor du Bois is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is brilliant. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful and brilliantly excellent. The story & screenplay by John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz, & Edward Zwick is emotionally powerful and brilliant. Go see this movie and it might inspire you and make you think about things in perspective. See it before you see "The Lord Of The Rings
 This movie was so great in all aspects. Tom Cruise excelled as the leading role. He brought humor, emotion, and charisma to his part that I really didn't think he could pull off. All of the Japanese Samurai characters were great and you will come to love them as the movie goes along. You can see why Cruise's character would rather live with them than his own people. The action scenes were awesome, but much more gory than even I expected. Those samurai swords can do some gruesome things. The movie is never boring, and it managed to keep my attention for the full 2 hours and 30 minutes. This movie is easily going to be nominated for best picture, music, and set design at the 2004 Oscars. Go see this extraordinary Movie..I guarantee you will be glad you did.
 This movie has action, drama, story, great cinematography and good acting. The fight sequences are well choreographed. The story is deep and has soul. It gave me that feel like when I saw dances with wolves and fighting spirit like Gladiator. This movie will bring the Warrior out of you once you get into it! If, like me you love Epics, History, Martial arts and ZEN stuff, You'll enjoy this movie hopefully.
 This film is definately on the top of my favorite movie list. Tom Cruise does a beautiful job portraying a Civil War veteran that is having a lot of difficulty accepting what occured in his past. He goes to Japan for a job of training a modern Japanese army fighting the last of the samurai that are rebeling against the ways of the government, but still fighting for the emperor. He ends up becoming a part of the warriors he was training to kill, and so begins the epic tale of Nate Algren. A memorable line that the charecter Nathan Algren states at the beginning of the movie is this
 Congratulations Ton Cruise you have finally made a film I can watch without wanting to punch you in the middle of your smug face, you took a back seat for once and let more talented actors have the stage.  I love the samurai genre and have seen probably every example (when the last sword is drawn is best in my view) and therefore felt compelled to watch this movie despite the fact I cant stand Cruise but in truth I have to say I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  It is superbly well made, visually stunning and very moving. Koyuki and uijo were deeply impressive as was katsumoto.  I have seen it six times now and it just gets better.  The soundtrack is worth buying on it's own. It deserved to have been  better received when it was released but it was in competition with 'the return of the king' which was unfortunate as the last samurai is far the better film.  No one I know who has seen this film has anything less than great admiration for it.
 This movie is one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen, with great acting, directing, and a great plot.  It keeps you interested for the full 2 and a half hours.  Nathan (Tom Cruise) is recruited (by his superior officer whom he despises) to train the Japanese army (he was a good warrior in the battles in the U.S. against the "Indians") as the Japanese are trying to civilize themselves and be a world power and they want to get rid of the Samurai and rural way of life and customs (including no firearms).  After being ordered to lead the Japanese Army into battle prematurely against the Samurai he is almost killed and captured by the Samurai as the Army gets demolished even with their guns.  He lives with the Samurai and their leaded Katsumoto, who after a while the two take a great liking to one another and Nathan begins to train with them and learn their lifestyle and discipline which he comes to highly admire.  After being returned almost 2 years later to the Japanese Army (which is 20 times larger now) he finds they have new firepower (gattling guns and cannons) and they will destroy the Samurai's in battle.  Katsumoto then turns himself in to the Emporer (who is his friend) only to be told he will die. But Nathan and the other Samurai's rescue Katsumoto and Nathan takes up w/ them in a battle against the whole Japanese Army.  That's all I'll tell you but you have to go see the movie, it's GREAT and you'll be pleased, especially at the ending and the honor and discipline that is promoted through the movie.
 I had the privilage of the movie and all i can say that it was amazing. everything from the acting to the set designs was great. The dialogue was very engaging and the fight scenes was out of this world, especially when TOM cruise's character fights Ujia in training. Tom does an excellent job and proves his acting can garner an oscar nomination for a lead role.
 I did not hear the best reviews of The Last Samurai when it came out. Many said it was a good film, but not up to the epic status it had obviously tried to achieve. My mother is not at all a Tom Cruise fan, so I did not hear much good about him either.   Then my grandparents glowingly recommended the movie to my whole family, and we decided to watch it with them one night when they came over. What I had seen when it ended was a moving, excellent film which, if not perhaps an epic, is certainly a wonderful tale of a culture and heritage slipping away from an ancient and lasting civiliazation.   As I said, this movie is perhaps not an epic on the scale of-The Lord of the Rings, for example. It does not contain quite the sweep and grand scale that the latter has in buckets. It is about honor, about discipline, and about a man from a completely different country who joins forces with the samurai. So no, I would not necessarily call it an epic, although it certainly contains some of the ingredients of one. Whether the director and screenwriters intended it to be, I do not know, but that certainly does not keep it from being one of the better films I have seen.   The hero is Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran and soldier in the 7th Cavalry who fought in the Indian wars. At the beginning of the film, however, he is not employed in warfare, but in promoting the weapons of the Winchester arms company. He does not come out to perform in time, however, and he is fired.   Another job comes his way, however, when his commander asks him to accept the offer of a certain Mr. Omura, a man highly ranked in the Japanese government who, in accordance with his and the Japanese emperor's wishes to westernize his nation, is employing American soldiers to train the Japanese army. Algren agrees, although horrible memories of attacking innocent settlements in the Indian wars make him loathe his commander.   Once in Japan, Algren assumes the responsibility of training the Japanese army, which consists mostly of peasants who have never even held guns.   Then, before the army is fully trained, a samurai leader, Katsumoto, a man who thinks Japan is changing too quickly, continues the rebellion he had previously begun by attacking the railroad owned by the same Mr. Omura who hired Algren. Algren's superiors insist on attacking, despite Algren maintaining that the troops are unready for combat.   Despite superior firepower and numbers, the Samurai win a resounding victory at the battle, and Algren is captured. But after several difficult months, he finds himself living among friends, not enemies. He is captivated by the ideals and disciplines of the samurai, and comes to fight on their side in a climactic battle whose outcome will decide Japan's future.   The directing is certainly very good-Edward Zwick seems to be one of those talented fellows who can have two characters very obviously love each other without commiting fornication. That was one of the most amazing aspects of this movie. The sister of Katsumoto comes to love Algren during the course of his stay, and they actually remain chaste. Wow! What a concept! I am sick of having well-made movies filled with trash that renders it off-limits, and The Last Samurai was refreshingly free of sex.   A word of warning, though-it is fairly violent, and there is some swearing, so despite it's good qualities I wouldn't recommend it for the younger children.   The camera-work is also excellent, giving us some views of the wonderful countryside of...New Zealand. I find it a little strange that this movie was not actually filmed in Japan, but the country is so beautiful I can overlook it, and it looked to me like a place that could easily be found in Japan. But I have never been there, so don't take my word for it.   The acting is good, and having no previous exposure to Tom Cruise I was able to be satisfied with his performance and not have any unpleasant memories from his past films. Ken Watanabe is very good as Katsumoto, and Hiroyuki Koyuki is wonderful as Katsumoto's sister.   But perhaps the best of all are the values in Last Samurai. Honor, devotion to duty, discipline, and courage to do what you believe is right in the face of danger are all lauded here. I don't think Western culture is being universally blasted here, but I do think the film makers are trying to say that technology is not all that matters; but that values and morals should be honored and practiced. Hollywood does not recognize that Jesus Christ is the only answer to life's questions and that He is the reason that all these morals are held in such high esteem, but they are at least doing something better than their ordinary fare.   Definitely recommended!
 This is the best damn tom cruise ever.I forgot that was tom and believed he was capt.nathan algren.this movie is a masterpiece.forget that review above and watch this instant classic.
 This is my favorite non-trilogy movie (RotK is actually my truly favorite), and while I respect anyone who loves this movie and gives it 5 stars, I must say that none of these reviews gives this movie any justice!  They tell you the basic story...an alcoholic Civil War guy...enemy...samurai!  While that is the story...there's a lot more to it than that!  What captivated me and all my friends (17 - 21 years old) was the Samurai...and, all the emotions of the story...an American kills the Red Samurai...who is the Samurai Captains Brother-in-law...he lives in the house and is cared for by the Red Samurai's widow...  Tom Cruise sees the beauty of the Samurai people and understands the honor and respect and culture and discipline of these people and realizes they are not the enemy!  He learns a lot from these people and earns their respect in many ways!  The widow...who knows Cruise killed her husband...offers the Red armor for Cruise to fight with Samurai against the Army Cruise was sent to train!  Beautiful movie in every way!  It is no way slow at any point!  When someone says this movie is "slow", it simply means they do not feel the emotion of silence and music and the visuals they see!  The battles are a very small part in the greatness of this movie!  But, the end of the last battle will have you reaching for a hanky!  The Samurai are a beautiful people!  Also recommended are Samurai books and old classic Japanese Samurai movies!  ...unless you think it'll be...slow!
 I just finished watching this movie and loved it!!!!! just as much as the first time i saw it. In memory of this movie i bought a set of samurai swords because i loved it so much
 This is a Great Movie And i love it.The price for it is cheap so it is a Must Buy!!
 I don't care if he's a little socially quirky (really what actor isn't).  I just loved this movie!  So subtly moving, and the cast was to die for!  Tom cruise is a great actor, love practically all his movies.  This movie was done exceptionally well, well done!
 This movie is NOT the sequel to Dances with Wolves! It's just the same movie except that instead of indians these are samurais!!  Of course, this movie have MORE ACTION than Dances with Wolves, more warfare, more cool fights and more blood!!! I could say that Last Samurai is better than Dances but ONLY because of the action, the story is a little predictable but still interesting.  P.S
 This movie is excellent in conveying a different and needed perspective about Japan at this period of history.  Much can be learned. Unfortunately, I am reading reviews from people that wanted a typical Tom Cruise action movie.  They were expecting a formula based on action, clever plot twists, and more action.  This does not require an effort to understand the beauty of another culture.  One reviewer complains that the Japanese actors were just being Japanese, and therefore not acting. After so many slice and dice 'em samurai movies, this one is a slice way above the rest.  Ken Watanabe starts the movie in deep meditation and having a vision.  His strong centeredness from meditation is carried through the entire film.  He did not get shaken by even the most insulting behavior from Cruise as Captain Algren.  This chemistry was special throughout the film.  This is a formula that includes real story telling, action, a demand to stretch your understanding, and more action.  Therefore, the reviews cite the action as good and the rest as bad.  I respect Tom Cruise a lot more now after seeing this movie, and knowing it became a personal project.  It does remind me of Kevin Costner and "Dances with Wolves.  I am sorry to see a less culturally open minded audience in 2004, outside of the Japanese American communities.
 As some people would rightly put this great, beautiful film as "Dances with Wolves of the East, the two people here who are being (or almost being) conquered by the Americans, as a representative of the Western "civilisation", have a lot in common. Not only the upheaval and tragic situations they had in those period, but I have found those two people's spiritual beliefs very similar to each other. Maybe that is because they both are kind of animists who believe that every things on Earth has spirit----trees, mountains, rivers, seas, rocks, etc.... Not to mention human beings and other creatures. The humans are only a part of the nature. So, like a weed grows and dies, we all are born and die. Simple.  Like the American Indians say; "It is a good day to die today.", famous book of Bushido, the Samurai code, "Hagakure says; "The ultimate Bushido is found in the way you die. Here, as well as profoundly understanding the meanings of life and death, accepting one's own life as it is is a crucial point to get through. Because you have your own purpose of life as you are born to the circumstances you were given. And it applies to everybody, not only to the Samurais. For what were you born? For what are you going to die? If you know the answer, you are ready to die in the honourable and graceful way it should be. It is not that only the deaths of Samurais in action or by Harakiri taking responsibility are honourable/graceful. Everyone who has completed his/her duty of his/her life can die in honour and grace. It doesn't mean that Samurais were crazy, trigger-happy suicidal/homicidal maniacs, though. I have to make sure here that nobody misunderstands what I am saying because sometimes some people seem to think that the Kamikaze attacks in the world war 2 were the acts of that kind of insanity. I can tell you how wrong their thoughts are. If you see this film and take it correctly, you should understand that as well.  It is a matter of readiness. Your readiness to die makes your life meaningful. Meaningful life makes your soul shine. That is every human being's purpose to be born to this world. Concuerors can destroy your home and kill you, but no one can break your spirit if you are ready to die. What Algren underwent in his battle fields in both America and Japan against and with those "savages made him know that.  After a hundred years' struggle against the powers of the Western civilisation, Japan seemed to have narrowly escaped from being colonised and subhumanised only because Japan had a large population that were ready to die for the survival of their country and their people putting themselves together tightly under the name of the Emperor. But, did she, really? "The Last Samurai made me think about where I came from and who I am. Maybe I and other modern day Japanese, who became conveniently Westernised and forgot about our spiritual roots should just stop and rethink of the meaning of life.
 First you must understand I am a huge Tom Cruise fan therefore my review may come off bias, but this is truly a great movie believe me or not! If you are a fan of epic movies (Braveheart,Gladiator, etc) then The Last Samurai is your film, and if you are a fan of the epic genre and Tom Cruise the world can get no better! This film has it all great cast, passionate and exciting storyline, and beautiful cinematography to top it off. I recommend this film to anyone and everyone, enjoy!!!
 Great transaction, product in excellent condition as promoted, prompt shipping and extra care taken with bubble wrap inside a padded envelope!  This seller is concerned that you receive product in same condition it was sent!!!  No USPO mail-mashing!
 Great performance of Tom cruise...I am not a big fan of him but I just love this movie.
 When I saw it the first time, I said, I must have that one! By this time I've seen it at least 20 times!!!
 i've seen this movie in a total of what, 100 times or somethin'. it's absolutely amazing. tom cruise was awesome. it even got me to shed a few tears when katzumoto's son died. if u haven't seen this yet, ur missin out.
 In short, great film to say the least and the music (Hans Zimmer) is excellent and blends perfectly with the movie.
 Drunken, war-weary Cruise accepts a mission to train Japanese soldiers but finds the old way more suited to his personal sense of honor. Filled with thrilling battle scenes, fabulous cinematography, and the rich culture of ancient Japan, "Last Samurai delivers on every level. Cruise's background and personal torment are glossed over a bit - this could have been explored more, and his romance with the widow of the warrior he defeats in battle is left unresolved, but this is a great adventure story. Highly recommend!
 Reading this may ruin your viewing of the movie, Last Samurai, by forwarning you of what it is about.  The latest Tom Cruise movie, The Last Samurai is a terrific movie-- portraying the role of big business in pushing for and aiding in the elimination of a native culture that was not supportive of trade and commerce, in this case, in Japan. And of course the US was there to provide and sell weapons and military training to kill the simple, less technological natives. Cruise plays a tortured yet heroic character, asurvivor of the Civil War and Indian wars who stands up to the commercial, US and japanese forces who are attempting to wipe out the last of the Samurais. He stands up to these powers because it is the right thing, the noble thing to do.  Why don't we see American warriors standing up. It is almost impossible for men and women GIs in Iraq to speak out. But where are the veterans who can see that the Iraq quagmire has been a bumbling fraud, built on lies and stupid unpreparedness. Where are the brave men and women who fought in Iraq in 1991 to free Kuwait, who should clearly see what a horrific travesty the Bush administration machinations have been.  The movie was one of the best of the year, with Oscar caliber acting, script, set, and costumes, in a season with a plethora of disappointing films. I left with a glow in my heart and feeling both inspired and disgusted-- inspired by the heroic actions Tom Cruise portrays, disgusted by the way the US government has had a history of helping in the wiping out of indigenous noble cultures.

 A beautiful movie following the same template in "Dances with Wolves". Certainly it is a bit unbelievable since one winter would not be sufficient for serious wounds of the hero to heal and for him to learn the life time practices of the warrior class, let alone become one of the best of them. But since when does realism enter into this art form? There is a nice touch in the love triangle between our hero and the wife of his fallen enemy -- and that enemy who "haunts him -- but that he comes to honor. What an interesting feature that adds marvelously to this template. What is the moral narrative of this story? Industry bad, nature good? Those who follow ancient practices good, modern science bad? But modern weapons win and the honor of fighting is lost.  This is a beautiful movie and provokes thinking.
 A very promessing film, The Last Samurai talks about something that is sacred to many of us
 Absolutely beautiful.  I have not enjoyed the few movies Cruise had done just prior to this movie (from Eyes Wide Shut on, they were pretty gross, disturbing, or just awful...and I'm a total Cruise fan).  So, hearing that he was going to be in a movie like this, I groaned and thought, "Damn.  I wish he'd done this movie five years ago.  He'll probably ruin it now.  But hey, I'm a total Japanese culture lover, so I figured I'd watch it anyway.  I thought I was disappointed with the movie when it began, because they set up the plot very slowly, and lay out a large amount of information that seems irrelevant.  But, like the quiet slice of sword through air, the pieces began to come together, and I found myself enraptured with the film.  Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto)'s presence on the screen is breathtaking, as were his family and friends.  Taka, the heroine, was beautiful in her silence, and the scene with her and Tom at the end was...well, unforgettable.  Omura is excellent and, like the rest of those mentioned here, enfuses so much emotion in one gesture or expression.  Nobutada (the archer) was, I believe, my favorite character outside of Watanabe.  His final scene had me sobbing.  But I think most impressive is the way that Tom Cruise doesn't dominate this film.  It's almost as if he, like his character, is enraptured and humbled by these people, and he's purposefully pulling himself in, so that THEY shine on screen.  Overall, an absolutely spectacular film.  It's perhaps a bit too intelligent for some, a bit too poignant for others.  It is, however, a film that I hope will inspire others.  Its lessons are vast.  I only wish there were a prequel, so that I could see Katsumoto, Taka, Nobutada, and Omura more, and in all their glory.
 Besides the emense amounts of gore *do to violent war scenes* it has beautiful scenery and wonderful messages of love. At first i though that this movie would be a waste of money, but i was very wrong. Even though i hate extreme violence this movie was an exception.
 Plain and simple if you like action this movie is for you.  If you like drama this movie is for you.  If you like foriegn this movie is for you.  iTs my favorite move, and Tom Cruise is awsome in this movie.
 "The Last Samurai is one of the best movies you will ever see on DVD! A sweeping and emotional film with powerful images and an incredible storyline. An incredible story about a man who tries to find his place and ends up pleading his cause to the way of the samurai.    The best part was at the ending. It had me crying buckets of tears. This scene told me I was watching probably the best drama film ever made (besides "The Passion of The Christ").  I strongly recommend this film. It is violent, but there are a lot worse movies out there. This film is an instant masterpiece.
 A good movie to watch as it not only has historical relations to it, it has a well brought together cast as well. I'd go in depth about the movie and everything, but why repeat what everyone else said? The thing to remember is this movie is rated pretty high cause it has intense battle scenes that resemble gladiator in its gruesome display of battle lust (not that I have anything against that). The one part I didn't like but is understandable since it has japenese actors in it is that halfway through the movie they start talking in japenese and you have to read the bottom of the screen to see what they say. Now if its 2am and your tired and sitting far from the tv, that can be a problem but as i said, cruise is in japan at that time so he should speak the language as well. Just in case anyone did miss it, basically cruise is the last man left in his unit when its taken out by japanese samurais. they spare him and hold him captive in their village. soon he embraces their culture and starts to find a little peace in himself. I'd say more but that'd ruin the movie and i said i wouldn't get all into it anyways 
 This movie was the greatest movie I've ever seen, it will continue to be my favorite movie for a long time. The war sequences were far better than any other movie like 'Saving Private Ryan'. The Last Samurai had better special affects and a most intriguing story. I loved the relationship between Algren and the Samurai class, the fight for survival in the newly modernized country Japan after 1868 when Meiji's reign as Emperor began. Its quite fascinating how this story, even though the character Algren and the dealings with the Americans were fiction how this story was so well drawn out. The character that portrayed the legendary Saigo, or "Dai Saigo otherwise known as a fictional character as Katsumoto did such a dramatically important role, a role in which it took a strong will and personality to play. The honor and prestige that each warrior felt back in history was shown in the faces of the individuals that gave their time and skills into making this film historically memorable. I love to read about Japanese history, and I can say right now that they did a spectacular job in recreating the nation of Japan back in the times of Meiji. domo arigatou.....ja ne!
 Just as the ocean has shallow ends and deep ends, The Last Samurai is a film whose story, in part, lies on the surface and also lies, in part, deeper beneath the surface. At face value, you will find a tale about an old world culture (the Samurai culture) clashing with a rising, powerful modern culture (Western culture). Although this is almost certainly an oversimplification of the story, the clash-of-cultures saga played out in this movie is basically the "shallow end of the premise. In fact, the story and setting in and of themselves are merely a convenient backdrop for which to convey its actual message; which is much deeper and more interesting.  Cruise plays 7th Cavalry Army Captain, Nathan Algren. He is a troubled and tormented man who is haunted by tremendous guilt, brought on by his experiences fighting and killing American Indians circa 1876. He is generally lauded as a hero around the US, ironically admired for the very actions that precipitate his self-loathing. He is not interested in fame or accolades; he is a man who desperately wants to escape his personal demons, but is completely helpless to suffer through them. Like many people who suffer from such inescapable torment, he turns to the bottle for his salvation. Still present are the post-traumatic nightmares and flashbacks of his war-fighting days. But alas, as he tries to drown his sorrows, they do indeed learn to swim. His acquired inclination toward the excessive consumption of libations notwithstanding, he does his best to cope, however unfruitful his efforts may be.  Although he has been begrudgingly following orders to this point, he nevertheless has done his best to fulfill them dutifully. By turn of events, Algren encounters a Japanese General named Hasegawa who has a profitable offer for him. Despite his heavy drinking, Algren is eventually hired to train the Japanese army in Western warfare and to use firearms in battle against the fierce battle-experienced Samurai. Western culture is all the rage in Japan, and powerful political influences want to wipe out the old system that was influenced by the Samurai Code in order to foster a modern Japanese culture. Algren is sent to Japan and finds a group of soldiers who know nothing concerning the use of firearms. He earnestly tries to train them properly so as to prepare them for battle, but Japanese General Hasegawa is impatient with the troops' development; and much to Algren's dismay, Hasegawa orders them to begin fighting Samurai even though the troops are ill-prepared to do so.  The first battle against the Samurai is disastrous for the secular Japanese troops, and a slaughter ensues at the hands of the defiant Samurai warriors. But Algren survives the battle and winds up being surrounded by several Samurai. Algren, ever the fearless warrior, stands his ground with a ferocious vigor, showing tremendous valor and honor in displaying that he will fight until his last breath. It is here that Samurai elder and leader, Katsumoto notices Algren's impressive will to fight to the death. Katsumoto, if only out of curiosity, spares Algren's life and keeps him as a "free captive in his Samurai village until winter passes. During his stay, Algren is treated with dignity albeit an underlying distrust and resentment from the local villagers. Because of his heavy reliance on alcohol, Algren begins going through terrible symptoms of withdrawal from it, as he is weaned from the grips of his addiction. Once his head becomes clear again, he begins to learn from the Samurai villagers' ways, being influenced by their strong principles and stoic way of life. It is through their cultural mindset that he begins to free his mind from the shackles of the nightmarish suffering that has dogged his troubled mind for so long. Indeed, Captain Algren experiences the personal growth and enlightenment that changes lives and raises one's consciousness above darkness and despair. It is during this portion of the story that the "meat of the movie lies. It is here that Algren begins to see life from a different perspective. The Samurai's life is a simple one that focuses on virtues espoused by The Samurai Way; values such as honor, integrity, respect, courage, justice, wisdom, etc. The way the villagers were portrayed in the film remind me of a real-life Samurai named Yamamoto Tsunetomo, who once said in a compilation of his writings entitled "Hagakure that one should
 The last Samurai was a really good movie. It was about a Captain in the American army that went to Japan to help train men for Japans new army to fight the samurai. The Captain gets captured during a battle and stays and trains with the samurai. In the end he fights for samurai. It is really good watch it.
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT. RECEIVED IN TIMELY MANNER.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ENJOY ACTION MOVIE, CULTURE ,AND ROMANCE.
 Although I have reviewed this movie with heightened interest, are the facts portrayed historicaly valid, and if so, where can I peruse more profound articles on the Internet that depict the Mercenary involvement between the United States and Japan?  I am a Social Studies teacher and would like to share this issue, if a true account, with other teachers in my local area.  Please respond by e-mail at your earliest convenience.  Thank you.

 Probably the best original historical movie, EVER.  I would even go as far as saying that it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life.  This is definately a must see, if not a must own.
 Blu-Ray Disc is not a DVD...but, they are both DISCS!  HD-DVD, which is DVD, is garbage!  It holds less than 15 Gigabytes on a single layer!  Blu-Ray holds 25 Gigs!  That's true high-definition!  The Last Samurai on HDDVD could have hardly any extra features because the movie would take up the whole space if it fit at all!  One LOTR movie would not fit on an HD-DVD!  Also, Blu-Ray made a disc that held over 30 Gigs on one side...but, didn't pursue it because they were almost finished with all their manufacturing with 25 gigs!  But, it's only time!  Besides all my facts that will in time grant Blu Ray the winner of this new movie format. The Last Samurai is great on Blu Ray!  Since I first watched this movie in the theater...I couldn't wait to watch it on Blu-Ray...I love this movie more...if that were possible!!
 I am not a Tom Cruise fan.  In fact I think he is a bit of a nut.  But...after saying that this is a good performance for him.  While the plot is fairly predictable I think it is an interesting look into a historical time period.  A transition from an ancient tradition in Japan into the modern age.  I would recommend the film to anyone who loves history.
 warner made another beautiful HD transfer.  I can't find another wrong, no grain anywhere.  Just a perfect crystal clear image from start to finish.  The cinematography will blow you away.  Would give this 6 stars if i could.  So far I find warner is the only studio willing to give HD addicts the best video quality possible.  Some studios just throw a title on blu-ray and expect us to say, thank you for releasing it.
 Brilliant performance not only from Tom Cruise but also from other Japanese actors &amp; actress. This is a relatively long movie last over 2.5 hours but you won't find a single boring scene. The Samurai's Bushido will really make you feel intense. The DVD comes with 2 discs. Movie is on the disc one and lots of extra goodies can be found from disc two. In addition to the regular features such as director's commentaries, making of the Last Samurai, and deleted scenes, etc., it also includes the Bushido's Way, Japan Premiers, and the 25 minutes documentary from History Channel
 The story focuses on a Civil War veteran named Capt. Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise). He reluctantly agrees to train and lead an army of Japanese soldiers to defeat rebellion of the country's remaining Samurai. Unfortunately, Algren is captured in battle by the Samurai, and is held prisoner by them. The leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe), is interested in the American culture and wants to keep Algren alive to learn from him. As time passes, Algren comes to develop a friendship with Katsumoto. He also comes to embrace the Samurai way of life as well, and trains to become one of them, so that he can fight along side of the Samurai against the Japanese forces that oppose them. With the acception of "Mystic River", "The Last Samurai was my favorite film of 2003. For 2 1/2 hours, I was literally glued to the screen, and loving every minute of it. It has been quite some time since I have been that captivated by a film. The only downfall this film may have, is the fact that the story is almost a complete rip off of "Dances with Wolves". However, that does not make the film any less enjoyable. In fact, "The Last Samurai is almost better. The story comes across as being much more dramatic and action packed when dealing with the Samurai. They have a deeper sense of honor, and their fighting style is much more deadly. Director Edward Zick did an amazing job of capturing every aspect of the Samurai culture, from the costume designs and simple way of life, to the weaponry and fighting style. The final battle between the Samurai and the Japanese soldiers is the best I have seen since "Braveheart". The Samurai are completely outnumbered, and still manage to put up one heck of a fight. Tom Cruise gave one of the best, if not the best performance of his career. However, the best performance of the film goes to Ken Watanabe. He was flat out amazing as Katsumoto and nailed every aspect of the Samurai warrior. The film's soundtrack and scenery are extremely beautiful as well. Overall, "The Last Samurai is an amazing film. Every aspect of the Samurai way of life is captured accurately, the performances given by the actors involved were amazing, and the final battle was incredible. Also, please check out the extras listed by Amazon for this 2 Disc DVD set. From the look of things, the extras are reason enough to purchase this film. There are deleted scenes, featurettes on the making of the film, a featurette comparing real life Samurai, and more. This is definately a bonus for myself and anyone else who appreciates the film, and the Samurai in general. A solid 5 stars...
 A stunning story and modern classic!  Very well told and acted.  The sets were incredible!  The evolution of the main character was played out perfectly, and the story within the story couldn't have been better.  This is a cinematic work of art!
 This is a must have for any Bollywood film collector. The soundtrack alone is worth the investment. The film is also very interesting and should bring a smile to most anyones face.
 THIS WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE, IT WAS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  THE DANCE SCENES WILL FOREVER BE IN MY MIND.  THIS WAS A GREAT BUY.  RECOMMEND HIGHLY.  IT'S LIKE AN OLD BOLLYWOOD FLICK BUT EVEN BETTER.
 Perhaps I have poor taste, but I was instantly hooked on this short series. So much so, I actually seeked out the original ADV release, with the three single discs and wonderful artbox (besides Bandai's magnetic artboxes, I think ADV comes in second with the sturdiest and coolest artboxes); instead of the usual black, clear or sometimes white colour case, the older ADV release came in never-before-seen-by-me light blue-like cases, which goes great with the whole dark, gothic look of the packaging; one thing good about boxed sets being released, the original material is cheaper to hunt down in the long run -- however, this double clear case 2-disc holder of this release was a nice change and surprise from the recent slimcase phenomenon that never protects the disc(s).  I also haven't read the manga, so maybe I remain ignorant; but evenso, I tend to enjoy my visual medium different than the written material, it leaves both to be special in their own right.  So I could care less if the anime takes liberty on storytelling or changes up the characters.  Crucify me.  With that being said, even after the first episode, I was attracted to and very much sucked in by the quick character development and the mysteries that shrouded around certain personalities.  I mean, come-on... an antique dealer (Lucia, a one woman Venus Vangaurd) storefront owner who takes on clients that see Virus-es (evil spirits - similar to xxxHolic) and runs a backroom where equipment is developed to fight off these corrupt souls?!?  Sign me up.  And then the sweet character girl Sumire, who at times needs to turn beserk-er (Claymore anyone?) in order to further battle the attacking Virus?  After being enthralled by such side characters as the cute soulless dolls in xxxHolic, and the battle drone soulless dolls of Murder Princess (another great 6 episode series), I was pleasantly surprised to be introduced to Laura/Lola and her twin sister... another great pair of soulless twin dolls.  Bonus.  I also have no problem with the hard-shelled bad-arse protagonist of the show ending up with somewhat of a hidden human-soft-side.  I thought the quality of animation was great, along with the recorded music and great colour palette used.  There was also just the right amount of comedic and serious moments.  The only downside to this short release?, simply wishing it was longer.
 After a lifetime of seeing ghost, young Sumire is recruited by powerful Lucia to fight demons! The gifls batttle darkness as members of the Venus. But as they discover why every life is worth saving, they also learn that they carry their own unlocked potential for evil. The Virus rages out of control, but Sumire and Lucia are prepared to give it the beating it truly deserves. Get ready its time for your vaccination.
 I love Sand Masters and wanted to buy the season in iTunes. Unfortunately it isn't available, and the season on DVD is probably cheaper anyway. If you love the show this is worth picking up.
 This video is hot! The dancers definitely did their thing and the host "Fish Patty is crazy funny! There are alot of sexy girls in this video!
 I decided I wanted to learn the autoharp. I really liked this tape better than some because it gave you the basic strums you could practice and easily put together. You must practice. The instrument is simple but takes practice to learn but after a few afternoons you will have fun strumming and picking your way thru familiar songs.
 The beginning of the video gives an important history lesson, reminding us that many of the great composers did not learn by rote lessons and first reading music.  The piano was a new invention and as such the people who first took a stab at it, played around on it.  They didn't have any music to read from at first, they hadn't even written any.  They played, experimented with chords and rhythms and combinations, got to know the keyboard inside out.  THEN they started writing down their music.   It was only after people liked what they heard the composers doing that they wanted in on the action  I want to do that too!   So companies started producing sheet music and from simple to complex arrangements that laypeople could play.  That's when piano  lessons  started.  But playing is like learning to talk.  First you learn to talk and you know the reason for language is to communicate.  You watch and listen to others around you, you mimic and emulate, practice and get it wrong a lot before you get it right.  Suddenly it becomes  natural  because you've used it EVERY day!  After that, learning to spell and to read make sense.   The premise of this instruction is that the same holds true with playing the piano.  It's drudgery starting to learn scales before you've been motivated by first making music.  Experiment first and learn to play through experiencing how the different sounds on the keyboard relate to one another.  It's an excellent foundation on which to build.   I learned a lot through this video and recommend it highly.  It provides a needed understanding on how to go about learning the piano in a way that makes it fun for life and has a casual, one on one feel to it.
 My seven year old son wanted to learn piano, so I bought a traditional piano book for children--he ended up in tears. I was searching for a way to teach him which wouldn't destroy his passion and creativity, or steal his joy of learning. While walking through the library, the title "Piano for Quitters caught my eye. Within days, my son was writing beautiful chord progressions and asking for "music practice to be added to his daily work chart so he could play the piano before his other jobs were done. Our whole family is now learning to play the piano and loving it! I am a former piano quitter--I managed to survive one year of traditional piano lessons, and tried various other piano methods, but by using Piano for Quitters (and it's sequal
 Great product!  I'm still learning to play, but this is the bible for learning to play the keyboard!  Glad it was offered on Amazon.com.  If you want to learn to play, you should try this first!
 Good plot, like the grittier feel of this installment.  Christian Bale does a good job as John Connor.  Good effects, great sound.
 I got the product very fast, good price and good conditions. In addition, the movie is the best of the best movies. thanks
 Terminator Salvation grows on you with each rewatching.  Christain Bale and Sam Worthington is great! Blair is awesome!! "I see a man", and it thinks its human.  Skynets virtual lady reveals the inner workings, while the 'it' chooses for itself. All great stuff.  I'd sign on for Christian bale-Arnie number 5, and this time with plasma's in 50 watt range..
 This movie is great, if you liked the other terminator flicks, you'll love this one. They said it was a new type of terminator this time around, and they weren't kidding.
 For those who love the Terminator franchise, this will be one more in a great line of flicks.  For those who have not followed this film series before, this will be only a decent action scifi offering.  Sam Worthington puts forth a solid performance as Marcus Wright the man who becomes machine and yet somehow remains a man.  Christian Bale's intensity as John Connor does not disappoint in communicating the weight, seemingly resting upon one man's shoulders, of saving humanity from the machine intelligence Skynet.  Great special effects including some gargantuan machines wreaking various levels of havoc make it exciting.  Terminator Salvation is a dependable addition to a movie collection for the scifi enthusiast.
 I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it was the best one I saw that year.  The story was straight sci fi.  The new vision of the terminator movie has a awesome variety of terminators.  They are done from a motorcycle type to a human skeleton type to a huge space ship type.  The visuals are very dark sort of like the last 2 alien movies were done.  Also I saw the late Stan Winston worked on the movie.  I think he did a lot of special effects in the alien movies.  I think he did the alien queen in aliens.  Anyway the special effect are really well done.  I could forget about reality and just watch the screen and go to another place.  That is when the special effects are done well.  Also the world was well done and you could tell they spent the money to design many sets and have many location to keep the viewer interested.  I compare the visuals of the world to that of Alien 3 or Alien Resurection.  The music is done well and is very emotional.  It was done by Danny Elfman.  The acting and story was top notch.  It is a story of sacrifice and redemption.  The two leads Sam Worthington and Christian Bale were exceptional.  Christian Bale is always good at getting you to care for his character.  I think he is an actor that can bring out a lot of emotions for the viewer.  I thought Sam Worthington was very good at this also in this movie.  The woman Moon Bloodgood was good also and believable in her role.  Anton Yelchin was also very good in his role.  Also this movie had very mild cussing and the violence and content was not trashy or overdone.  Which I think the last terminators went overboard on this.  Recommended to families to watch with children over 13.  I think the parents won't find anything objectionable.  If you haven't seen this due to hearing that it wasn't good.  Give it a chance.  I liked it, maybe you will too.  Kevin
 I really like this movie, although didn't noticed the difference betwen the director's cut and the thretical version. So any way, liked the movie.
 I love this movie, It is intense and very action packed. I seen it in theaters and I loved every minute of it.
 I got Terminator Salvation for Christmas because I have the first 3 and need to keep the series going. (Doesn't everyone do that?)  It picks up long after the events of Terminator 3
 *Note* This review is for the theatrical version ONLY.  First thoughts...It's not bad. I was a little worried about this one because it got a PG-13 rating when the first three were all R. It was actually very good though. Here's the breakdown.  1.  Directing--Good job from McG (Catwoman). It had a very good camera job, I was impressed. 2.  Script--Good script from the same people who wrote Terminator 3, John Brancato and Michael Ferris. 3.  Acting--Very good. You have an all-star cast. Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Oh, and let's not be forgetting Michael Ironside.  Now for the content review. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.  1.  Sex/Nudity=2/10. There is a brief scene where a terminator is shown fully nude but his genitals are blurred by smoke. 2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. Even though it got a PG-13, it is still pretty violent. 3.  Language=4/10. Least language of all the Terminator movies. A couple S-words and other profanities.  Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. I enjoyed this one far more than Terminator 3. Still, it would have been better if James Cameron directed it.
 I love you terminator. Anyways, crank the surround sound and bass! i cant wait for them to make an installment with the laser sounds because just with the bullets in this one, it sounded amazing, everything!
 I saw this Terminator movie and decided since I have that in my collection I also need to get the original movies especially since Arnold is the original machine. I was really excited at the animated Arnold in Terminator Salvation. It is so true that the movies are just not the same without him.
 This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay!
 REALLY loved this version. Story was more cohesive than the studio suits allowed it to be in the theatrical release. McG is a fine story teller and was made more evident in this director's cut. If there is more coming,will buy that too!  MOON BLOODGOOD IS HOT in this movie!!! Love seeing her on screen.
 I recently watched this movie and I really enjoyed it.  Having seen the previous three movies, I was skeptical, but it really had good continuity; especially with the first two Terminator movies.  I think they should actually make another movie to continue this story line.  What I didn't like was the way Amazon constantly changed the price and finally bumped up the full screen addition to $24.99.  I went to ebay and bought it brand new for $9.99.  Amazon needs to be more competitive.
 This will probably turn out to be the strangest 5 star review you've ever read so bear with me. I will start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish! I had really high expectations from the moment the initial trailer was released and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least. This is an action movie of the highest order! The CGI was outstanding! I have to take issue with those reviewers who claimed the CGI was not realistic. I have to disagree. I would say this is one of the more realistic CGI movies I've ever seen! The entire movie had a gritty, organic feel to it that was at once bleak and beautiful. Those of you looking for a slam bang good time filled with explosion after explosion you will be very happy.  However - and this is a BIG however - those of you looking for a movie with any kind of depth, emotion, or character development will be sorely disappointed! This ain't T2 people! The thing that made Terminator 2, and to a certain extent the original Terminator, so compelling was the depth of emotion James Cameron (absolute genius that he is) brought to his characters. The idea behind T2 was that if a machine, built for the sole purpose of death and destruction, can develop human feelings of empathy and compassion, then perhaps there is hope for all of us. The initial reviews of Terminator Salvation hinted at a similar theme
 I really enjoyed this movie.  I've seen all the Terminator movies, I don't listen to critic's, I never have. I like what I like.
 &lt;&lt;&lt; A few continuity errors (spoilers?) follow the Octothorpes >>>  Earlier this year I enjoyed "Terminator Salvation on a big-screen digital theater with a group of sci-fi friends and we all loved it. Then, being a huge fan of the Terminator franchise, I jumped at the chance to buy the 2-disc Blu-ray release. I just finished watching the "Director's Cut and must admit to you all that "I Forgot How Good This Movie Is". It is a good sci-fi story, as well as a good sci-fi movie.  But let's be realistic, it was the only sci-fi movie of 2009. "Transformers 2 was a fantasy and "Star Trek (reboot) was a futuristic soap opera with one of the poorest sci-fi plots I've ever seen in a movie theater.   #########################################################  &lt;&lt;&lt; Tiny Continuity Errors >>>  1) in both releases, there is a noticeable annoying gap between the time that John Connor "exits the rescue plane then "enters the submarine". This could have been easily fixed.  2) in the Director's Cut, the rain mysteriously stops between the time that John Connor leaves Blair Williams then returns to save her from attack by three men. This could have been easily fixed.  3) one possible plot weakness
 I thought this was a great Science Fiction film. Granted it was later surpassed by District 9 and Avatar, but this movie was the best one for the summer. It wasn't without problems, but it had a terrific atmosphere to it, a lot of innovative shots and an exciting plot which moves along nicely.  This is what I expected from this film, a sort of a prequel and a sequel that sets up the events of the apocalypse, of the Skynet fallout.  What's not to like here? The cool characters? the solid acting by Bale, Worthington, Kyle Reese, the Moon character.. the intense fighting scenes? the feeling of the great sadness... similar to that of Battlestar Galactica Reimagined? It was all quite beautiful.
 Great movie, everything I expected for a continuation of the Terminator story, and then some.  Very well done.  Highly entertaining.  The ONLY flaw is when they introduced Arnold S's terminator model (T101?)... it was clearly computer generated and looked a little fake, but not too bad.  (Humans ARE hard to do in CG, so...)  That aside, this was a GREAT movie.
 This is a great addition to the Terminator series. Great story line which sets it post Judgement Day in Western California(Los Angeles, San Francisco, places in between) But was actually all filmed in Arizona which helped with the barren desert landscape design. You also really get a good look at the many designs of machines in this film which James Cameron didn't have the time to get into detail in Judgement Day. T-1s, T-600s, T-700s, T-800s, Hunter Killers, Moto-Terminators, The Harvester, you name it...this movie has it. Now actorwise, Christian Bale(The Dark Knight) as John Conner is for sure a lot better than the guy who played John in Rise of the Machines, very bad ass with a REAL desire to kill the machines and save his father, Kyle Reese played by Anton Yelchin(Star Trek). Then...finally...Sam Worthington(Avatar) as Marcus Wright...oh my god...I tell you, if Sam Worthington didn't play this role I don't know who would have. In 2003 Marcus Wright is on death row for killing 2 cops and his brother, he donates his body to Cyberdyne after his execution for experiments. He is then awakened in 2018 as a one of a kind infiltration prototype terminator which befriends an A-10 pilot, Blair Williams played by Moon Bloodgood(Street Fighter) and a love story forms after Marcus saves her multiple times. You will find out that Marcus Wright is the key to get John Connor into Skynet to save his father from being terminated. This talented aussie actor really did a break out role in this film and is my personal favorite character. This film has non stop action, amazing actors, and great effects to make this personally one of the best Terminator films yet.
 This movie was the best movie I have seen in a while.  I will just leave it at that.  The ending you get a very cool surprise.  Can't really explain why it's good but if you like action movies and Terminators then this is the movie for you.
 I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MOVIE RECIEVED THE SHORT END OF THE STICK,ITS MY FAVORITE TERMINATOR MOVIE.GREAT ACTING ,ANTON YELCHIN ,BRICE DALLAS HOWARD,MOON BLOODGOOD,CHRISTIAN BALE,SAM WORTHINGTON,GREAT ACTORS ,,STORY & MCG DID AN AWESOME JOB.I HOPE THEY WILL MAKE ANOTHER ...BUT MOST LIKELY NOT IT TOOK OVER 2 YRS TO COME OUT .SOMETIMES PEOPLE CANT GET OVER THE ORGINAL ,I HOPE MORE PEOPLE SEE THIS MOVIE & RELISE JUST HOW GOOD IT REALLY IS
 I'm a big Terminator fan, and I loved this one no less.  Sam Worthington did a great job.  I even thought Christian Bale did a good job.  Seen in many times and will watch it many more.  "Come with me if you want to live...... I can't believe these reviews turned into rants, never knew so many people cared about the extra features. Anyway, to address the issue at hand, I happen to think that Terminator is the greatest movie franchise of all time (sorry Star Wars nerds). James Cameron did a great job on T1 and T2 and Salvation was a fantastic addition to his masterpiece (lets not mention T3). The only things missing from Salvation are the constant chase vs escape feelings and the confusion over how events fit in the puzzle of time. There are also a lot more depictions of other humans involved in the war, John Connor is not a hero yet. True fans of Terminator will notice several references to the previous editions, which I found to be funny. Note
 Got to me quick and before the scheduled Time.  Okay movie.  Plot is weak.  Action good.
 This was one of the best terminator movie yet, evryone play their part and it was just a sit down and enjoy yorself type moive, I Recommend this movie to anyone that like action pack and hold on to the edge of your set movie.
 Skynet becomes aware in 2003 and all hell breaks loose. Machines make the Earth their stomping ground for the next 18 years, while humans find themselves hunted and terminated by specially built machines. All the while, John Connor fights alongside of the Resistance, making certain that the "prophecy about his future comes true. Skynet also knows about this prediction and begins taking measure to stop this by hunting him and Kyle Reese to keep Judgment Day's purty end machine-based, building all sorts of interesting things into this now 15-year-old storyline. Then there's Marcus, the sub, the signal, and a few dozen other things that are best left to the movie to describe.  Out of all of the Terminator movies, i have to say that i liked this one the best. Instead of having one machine going after one person, we finally have the future that we had been promised. Sure, this isn't far enough for Connor to get his wings and take out the net, but it does show just how far he''s come. Scenes like those with him meeting high command also show how much skepticism is going around about him and his supposed future, but that doesn't seem to bother him. The thing he worries about is Kyle and meetting him, not to mention the fact that Skynet has the two of them on a kill list. and then there's Marcus - something that he doesn't have the slightest notion how to deal with.  One of the things i liked about the movie were the different types of machines that Skynet had built. It has collection machines, Hunter/Killers patrolling the sky, machines to kill all foot traffic, things on the road, and T-600s everywhere. We are just now up to the T-800 launch as well, and we are just now up to Skynet beginning its "dark times. so, humanity still has a fighting chance when battling and it isn't like the first movie. The fields of skulls may exist somewhere but, along with those, the humans have A-10 Warthogs and other weapons. This makes for some good fights, some interesting moral dilemmas, and some themes I wasn't expecting. It seemed like a thinking person's skynet, which I thought was interesting in the making.  If you are a fan of the series I figure you will go here anyhow. People who do not like it may want to check it out anyhow because this movie is different. It breaks a lot of cyclical bonds while still keeping the story, making it interesting. Personally, I liked it above all the others, and I even remember the first through a child's eyes - and it was something else. Recommended and then some.
 I keep seeing a lot of people calling the 3rd movie "campy", and the 2nd "the best". I think these are just everyday movie goers saying things like that. Fans of the series who like action will like T2 the best, but fans more into horror say the 1st will never be beaten. Terminator
 I'll agree with other reviewers that this will probably be a movie most will either love or hate. Personally, I loved the movie and thought it was a great followup to the other Terminator movies. Be warned, however, that if you go into this movie expecting it to be like the past films- well, you be the judge. Whereas the other films dealt with alot of storyline about the Terminators, Cyberdine and Skynet; this film does very little to push that envelope along. In its' place, all we see are alot of action sequences with different types of machines and some Terminator action but not alot. Other than that, the cast was well chosen with all giving solid performances.  The story takes place in 2018. Judgment Day has come and gone. John Conner is hard at work trying to convince the rest of the world that he is the key to their salvation from the Terminators. Marcus Wright is a death row prisoner who submits his body to experiments as penance for crimes he has committed(yet only hinted at in the movie). Awaking in 2018, Marcus discovers that the world has been destroyed and is no longer as he remembers it. Along his way, he meets up with Kyle Reese and that's where the movie pretty much starts.  While I think Termintor Salvation is a great movie, it was pretty much done in McG's over the top style of filmmaking that he did in Charlie's Angels/Charlie's Angels
 No!  This is not ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S Terminator.  And NO, James Cameron's hand was not involved directly with this film.  The lore of the Terminator Franchise has actually grown beyond requiring Arnold's presence or James Cameron's input, although a very good CG version of a younger & buff Governator DOES appear in the film.  I was ecstatic that we FINALLY got to see Chapters from the war of the last remnants of humanity against the machines, whereas the other films only teased us with brief glimpses of the conflict.  THIS storyline sets the stage for FUTURE chapters.  While THIS Terminator movie lacks some of the tounge & cheek dialogue that the previous movies contained, it is JUST as good in terms of action, mission, storyline, & acting performances, especially from the newcomer, Sam Worthington, who portrays Marcus Wright and actually has as much if not, more screen time than Christian Bale. I actually wondered if Christian Bales' on set tirade or political maneuvering not only resulted in lackluster reviews for THIS movie by the "Critics", but also resulted in the cancelling of one of the most intelligent and action packed sci-fi series to come along since "Firefly", "Terminator
 I really enjoyed Terminator 4 aka Terminator Salvation, and I hope that if Terminator 5 comes out, it has all the future scenes from Terminator, T2, and T3. This was a radical movie. I got to see new forms of robots that Skynet created. I thought that this movie was a nice departure from bad cyborg-good cyborg fights. it was cool to see Roland Kickinger with a CGI of Arnold's face, as Arnold played a T-800 in all 3 Terminator movies. it was freaky how the cyborg gun turret recognized Marcus Wright, but did not shoot at him, because it knew that he was a Terminator cyborg. it didn't matter to me that Arnold was not in this movie, because I got a good thrill out of it none the less.
 This movie never really never got the credit it deserved at the box office.  This is a really good action flick.  My husband said it was the best movie he'd seen in a long time (and we watch a lot of movies).  It's got non-stop edge-of-your-seat action, and I thought Christian Bale was GREAT as John Connor.  Newcomer Sam Worthington was good in this, too.  If you read the reviews, you'll see what's driving the number of stars down is the fact that people don't like it that there are extras on the blu-ray version, but not the regular dvd version.  This movie gets five stars from me.
 I waited till Dec 1 to buy this and it was AWESOME! This movie had all the elements of the Terminator movies, it had the cyborg tracking John, it had the Terminator chase scenes (again and again), it had the fiery Terminator factory end scene, YES!, it had Arnie as the Terminator and he looked very, very close to how he looked in T1/T2, it had Sarah Connor, the music, the story, the director, it was all pieced together so well and Bale makes it so believable with his angry acting, just awesome. BUY IT!
 many of the old fan hates this movie. I am young fan and like the war of future. terminator Sarah Connor chronicles made me a fan. There so much to take advantage of.  If have not watch the trailer this movie should more thrilling.  The moives does have it flaws like john Conner's wound at the end. Also it the main character Marcus really helps make the movie.
 It's difficult these days to please a sophisticated world audience.  We've seen it all and it takes a lot to move us, inspire us, make us feel the gamut of emotions and be entertained.  Yet this installment of the Terminator series does just that.  IMHO, it ranks as one of the best epic science fiction movies ever produced.  The acting is outstanding, the characters are endearing, compelling and artfully developed.  Christian Bale plays the perfect relentless and conflicted John Connor. Sam Worthington beautifully brings the brave heart of Marcus Wright to life along with the tragic circumstances of his existence.  Moon Bloodgood excels at playing the beautiful Blair Williams a woman with unflinching strength and conviction.  The sweet youthfulness and fearless persona of Anton Yelchin playing a perfect Kyle Reese along with newcomer Jadagrace Berry (Star) together make the perfect complement of innocence contrasting starkly with their life on the bleeding edge.  The special effects were first rate, along with the script, sound and pace of the movie.  If you love sci-fi, you're going to love this movie.
 I liked Terminator 1, #2 is one of my all-time favorite movies, #3 was a sad joke, and #4 is a fitting end to a wonderful series.  I liked the little details that tied in and paid tribute to the previous movies
 The director's cut runs approximately 3 minutes longer, and inserts a few new scenes, but no major plot points.  This is NOT the major unrated cut that McG has referred to in past interviews, where he suggested that 30-40 minutes of additional footage would be added.  We'll probably see that in a future edition.  Here are the major differences between the theatrical version and the director's cut (spoilers follow).  1) In the opening action scene, when John Connor is leading his unit into the flooded underground Skynet base, a T-1 terminator (nice touch from T3) suddenly appears behind them.  His men destroy it before it can do any damage.  I'm glad this scene was cut; it inadvertently breaks the tension too quickly.  2) When John pulls his little "frogman stunt", he is seated before the Resistance Command generals, and General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) berates John.  Ashdown says, "I don't believe in prophecy, not when one can re-write the future", pulls out his gun and points it at John's head.  I liked this scene, because it illustrates John's present and minor role in the Resistance, especially with Command being skeptical of his "predictions".  3) Blair Williams/Moon Bloodgood's topless scene; really just a side shot as she washes herself in the rain in a non-sexual manner, and Marcus glances at her briefly.  4) Marcus/Blair Williams/redneck fight; the action is a little longer, and a little more brutal.  Marcus stabs one of the attackers with a screwdriver, and we see the impact, as well as the victim painfully removing the screwdriver.  Also, Marcus uses another one of the attackers as a human shield against another's shotgun blast.  5) Marcus/Blair Williams campfire scene is slightly longer with additional dialogue between the two.  6) Captured humans at Skynet; when one of the prisoners attempts an escape and is shot, we see the bullet impacts.  7) John Connor's speech to fellow Resistance members to not obey Ashdown's orders to attack is extended with a few sentences about his mother.  I liked this scene, not sure why they cut it.  It ties T2 in, and shows the impact of Sarah Connor.  (Is this where Christian Bale had his stage lights tantrum?)  8) Marcus/T-800 fight scene is slightly longer, shows Marcus getting pummeled a bit more by the T-800.  Also, John tries to revive Marcus an additional time, before collapsing in exhaustion.  I would like to add that I enjoyed Terminator 4; much better than the campy T3, and just a shade under T2.  The action was definitely there, and McG included a lot of thoughtful touches from the past movies, e.g. photograph of Sarah Connor, the origin of John's scars, John's like for Guns N'Roses, Sarah Connor's taped voice recordings (actually Linda Hamilton's voice), use of and of course the Arnold cameo.  Who can say no to Michael Ironside?  What I didn't like was Blair Williams' geisha makeup which she wore during air combat.  It made no sense, and was probably one of the deleted portions.  Bryce Dallas Howard was believable as Kate Connor, but her screen time was too short.  Hopefully, a future cut will show more of her relationship with John.  Some have said that Christian Bale's performance was wooden, or that John Connor's role was overshadowed by Sam Worthington's role as Marcus Wright.  I disagree with both counts; Bale played Connor as he should have been; grizzled, scarred, gruff.  Given that we know so much already about the future and John's role from prior Terminator movies, it makes sense to have another character portray the center protagonist role.  I also liked the idea of the audience first seeing John as a minor Tech-Com officer, steadily rising through the ranks and gaining influence.  Additionally, the movie's opening and closing scenes had a poetic touch to it, which I appreciated.  Marcus begins the film about to be executed, giving his body to a cybernetic program.  The film ends with the same shots of needle plungers being depressed, albeit for a different reason.  Marcus leaves the world as a cyborg, but giving his body to a human cause.  I did have one concern about the movies; how come the Arnold T-800 didn't die when John Connor shot the molten steel onto its head?  Turns out there's a perfectly scientific explanation (McG consulted a metallurgist).  Here's McG's answer
 while in the broad view this movie progresses the plot very little it is a solid action movie and covers the plot terrifically. the action isn't over the top and any explosion scenes are executed perfectly without making it over the top. you should probably watch the first three movies to be able to pick up on the plot immediately but you can get only fine if you don't assuming you've seen the first 3 previously
 Excellent movie.  It successfully tied the three previous Terminator movies together with Salvation, all the way from Arnold to Skynet.  Great special effects, too. This is a MUST OWN MOVIE if you own and/or enjoy ANY of the three previous Terminator's.  The Arnold Terminator was a fantastic surprise when I saw the movie for the first time in the theater. The Arnold-factor alone truly solidifies a bond between all four movies.
 I have to give this five stars because I think most of the bad reviews are from one of a few types of people
 I will be the 1st to say when I saw this in theaters I left with alot of questions. But with the maximum movie mode where McG pops up every now and then and explains things and tells you the thought process for alot of scenes I finally understand how this one fits the other 3. Still I think only the true die hard fans of  the Terminator movies will appreciate  this movie.
 I liked the movie it goes along with the story and they even brought back the original terminator "Arnold Schwarzenegger. A lot of action and destruction so if your a guy like me which loves vilence then this a good movie to see if you haven't seen it.
 OK, this a must own, I enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy the whole series. Finally we are in the future. The fight is never over.
 Saludos! Para las personas que quedaron decepcionadas con la ultima entrega (me incluyo) de las pel&iacute;culas de terminator llega esta nueva que revive esta gran saga
 The director's cut is better than the original but did not have as much added back as I would have liked and I personally think the special features would have fitted on the movie disk. This movie could have been better if it had more scenes added back in or at the least more special features.
 I actually liked this movie... Of course im used to seeing Arnold in these series. But, the story line of this movie kept me interested enough to keep watching. It's definitly worth watching!
 If you have liked even one of the Terminators, then you will like this one.  My favorite of them all.

 After seeing this film in theaters I immediately drew a comparison to Blade Runner.  That film was released at a time where critics complained about the lack of a strong narrative and not enough substance.  I think this film befell a similar fate and was widely dismissed upon release.  Well I loved every minute of this film from the opening frame and waited over 6 months for the Blu-ray release.  This movie is not only highly entertaining but also touches upon the ideas that make us human.  I think after the Cristian Bale rant was somehow released a lot of the critics and audiences failed to appreciate his performance and considered this movie to be a mindless action film.  It's funny that the Transformers movie came out a little after this movie and was really panned (rightly so) for being a mindless exercise.  This film at least builds upon the previous mythology and creates several new interesting characters such as the Sam Worthington character who is only looking for a second chance.  At the end of the day I think in years to come this film will be given a second chance and will be appreciated for it's strong narrative, brilliant casting, wonderful cinematography, creative action scenes and strong direction.  Ever since the first Terminator film I have waited for another dark mythology driven fantasy of a future that is always a possibility.  We must never forget what makes us human.
 i love this movie in the teather, but in blue ray is more detailed and with an excelent sound you will centanly enjoy
 This was a gift for my son-in-law for Christmas and I got it for a super price because I pre-ordered it on Amazon as a gift. Thank you Amazon
 Hello !, I received this B-RD in time and not damage, cheers!. Best regards
 I just seen this movie about 4 days ago. Its a really good movie, and honestly the best out of the Terminator series. Definitly a movie worth buying. SO GET IT LOL.
 I'm a Terminator fan and like all the movies and I wasn't disappointed with this one for sure.  It was also at a very reasonable price through Amazon especially since it had just come out on DVD.  I'm happy with my experience.
 Terminator Salvation was predictable and mostly unrealistic.  However, there was a gritty emotional component to the movie and storyline that just worked enabling you to connect to the characters.  As a result, it was a darn good movie.
 great continuation of the Terminator saga.. Salvation should of came right after T2-JD, but at least we have it now! love it, love it!!
 I gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas.  This was what he had asked for.  He's watched it and enjoys it.  Shipping was immediate and the DVD was in perfect working order.  This is the place to buy.  Never a problem.
 the product arrived way before the deadline in perfect condition, I would say NEW or like new.
 A terminator that is not advertise the star of the show ,but really brings the story in a better level than the other terminators . To all of these people Bravo !!! GOOD JOB.
 THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OKAY HOWEVER, PREVIOUS MOVIES WERE AT ANOTHER LEVEL. MOVIE SEEMED DARKER THAN NEEDED BUT ACTING OFFSET SOME OF IT, WOULD RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO OTHERS.
 This is a terrific movie for a loyal follower of the Terminator Series. Christian Bale does a fantastic job in his role as John Conner. Intense, gripping and hold onto your seat action. Excellent sequel. I do hope he does a second movie as the same character.  One of best things was the delivery of this movie to my home. Ordered it on Friday morning and was watching it the next day! Cudos Amazon!!!
 I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he has already watched it 4 times. Looks great on his new bluray player. He said it's even better than watching it in the theater.
 This movie is nowhere near bad as people say it is. It isn't even near bad period!  Now some may have had different expectations going into it of what it would be, but that's their own fault. The movie is awesome.
 great pic that fills the gap, and like the other films has the terminator as the savior
 Being a loyal fan of THE best terminator of the series (the first one) and having seen the sequels; I set my expectation levels very low for this one; particularly because of the PG-13 rating which reaked of pandering to the mainstream.  I have to say... I was shockingly surprised at how enjoyable this movie turned out to be. I don't have to mention how amazing the action sequences were but they were some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. While a few reviews mention the story and editing being choppy, I would have to agree only with the editing. The story linked the past sequels surprisingly well while at the same time creating an alternate future with a whole new subplot involving a whole new character. If you know your T- Series movies.. you know what I am talking about. Little touches throughout the movie added to the nastalgia such as the GNR moment, Arnold coming back (sort of) as the original terminator which looked so real. They literally took shots of the original movie to put arnold back in this movie so he looked just as he did in 1984. Even the scar on John Connor's face (which is in a future scene on T2) was added in the movie when he was scratched by the terminator. Little touches for fans like us made the movie that much more fun to watch.  I have to compliment the actors as well. I trully believed these characters would become the actors in the earlier movies especially Kyle Reese. Although, I found myself scratching my head with the little girl who added absolutely no value in the past sequels or this movie's story line.  This movie is a must see for T fans and new fans since it can also be watched as a stand alone movie. I was truly surprised at how much fun I had watching this movie, even though it's the first to tone it down with a PG 13 rating. I really wish they would have made it darker and grittier by making an R rating but it does rank as my second favorite in the series.
 I've seen this Blu-ray twice, Director's Cut once. The extra three minutes isn't much, but it does add a bit of smoothness to the story. If an extended version ever comes out (late 2010?) I'll be there to get my copy. I also read most of the complaints about this movie in between my two viewings. It didn't make any difference. Thankfully this movie doesn't remind me of T2 that much. Instead I think of Blade Runner and the recent TV series Battlestar Galactica. These are all treatments of similar ideas (replicant androids, and/or dominant robots) which I really enjoy.  I'm happy with the story, the casting, the acting ability of the cast, and the state-of-the-art production quality; AND the design and visual concepts, special effects, music, etc., etc. Considering the 118 minute running time, I don't see where a minute was wasted in telling the tale. Some of the complaints I've been reading here are about what more explanation the story needs. The-Powers-That-Be have cut it to its current length. We'll have to wait for a longer version.  I don't get all the complaining! One person says there are too many characters and the scope is too large; but T4 is a world war. Other people refer to the original films as being better somehow, and I heartily DISAGREE. I confess! I've never liked Arnold's Austrian-accented "witticisms", and I also did not enjoy him as a "good guy in T2. T1 was better, but that was a long time ago. Now that everybody has been schooled on the foundations of the Terminator saga, it's time to step up to the next level of the story. T4's director, McG, did just that, and very well, IMO.
 Ordered this for my husband for Christmas - he was very excited!  Exactly what I ordered and I received it very quickly!
 I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!
 One of the best movies to come out of 2009, Terminator Salvation was exactly what the franchise needed to reinvigorate itself.  2003's Terminator 3 did for this franchise what the Maginot Line did for France in WWII
 I have to disagree with the critics when they cut this film down.  First off, yes, they will probably never make a terminator film as good as T2 again.  However, this film was very entertaining.  It was a really nice spin to add another substantial character to the mix.  The story was good, special affects amazing and acting was great.  The action sequences were nicely done as well.  The Blu Ray looked just as good as I remember in the theater and comes with a nice amount of extras considering the cheap price it's selling for.  Don't expect alot from the added three minutes.  There were a couple small scenes I noticed and the rest were indiscernible.  Looking forward to T5.
 I dont care what naysayers or even critics who get paid to criticize the film, this IS a worthy sequel. Sure it aint the same without Arnold being there throughout the movie but ever since watching flashbacks of the future war in the previous installments, id say it was about time that someone made a film that shows what happens next after judgement day happend. If you watch closely, you would notice more than one homage to the first two films. From seeing the ruins of observation area where the first terminator arrived in T1, Marcus showing Reese how to handle a shotgun by tying a string to it which Reese did in T1 to help hide his gun in his trenchcoat, to a similar chase scene with a truck & the motor-terminators lookin like the first chace scene in T2, and even John Connor playin ( You Could Be Mine) by Gun's N Roses to lower a motor-terminator into a trap etc. Anton Yelchin really impressed me as a young Kyle Reese throughout the film just as Sam Worthington played a great cyborg who later finds out he's a pawn to eliminate mankind. Christian Bale pulled off John Connor well himself. As for Moon Bloodgood, Common, & Bryce Dallas Howard i would say it was unfair to discredit them when they didnt get that much screen time. But anyways, if you're a true terminator fan you will enjoy this film. Especially the climax that leaves you wondering what awaits John connor in further battles. Keep in mind that the film takes place in the early years of the war and if you still dont like it, stick to the Terminator
 What a great film! Blu ray is awesome! Not only great film and sound but tons of extra's that give a great couple hours enjoyment.
 First of all I absolutely LOVED the 1st movie, *kinda* liked the 2nd, and DESPISED the 3rd. I don't actually care why other people gave this movie bad reviews (to each his/her own) but I have had someone tell me they thought Terminator Salvation was "too dark".  Well yeah... That's the type of movie it's meant to be--post-apocalyptic and all. This was the future I've been hungry to see ever since Reese's flash-backs from the 1st movie and I'm glad it wasn't just another excuse to show off some cute smart-mouthed kid actor, etc... This one was gritty, which is really something I happen to dig in sci-fi movies.  Sometimes the reviews don't do justice. See it for yourself and decide whether or not you like Pepsi ads and Guns n Roses or a dark, moody thriller and, uh, more Guns n Roses...
 The Terminator Saga has been one of the most recognizable in science-fiction film lore and for good reason. The idea of timeline manipulation and the impending machine rebellion (which we all know is coming, right? 
 This movie was really good.  Confused how so many did not give it a good rating on Yahoo and other sites.  I am impressed.
 Didn't even know about this addition to the series until I was looking at them on Amazon.  Will enjoy watching it with the rest of the series
 Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.  The video quality was excellent.  The item description above says it is 2.40
 THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE AND I HAVE EVEN GIVEN IT OUT TO MY FRIENDS TO WATCH IT. CHRISTIAN BALE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE JOHN CONNOR.
 As soon as I found out they were making another Terminator I was like "oh. no! Not again! I loved the first two movies (Classic scfi), but the third movie was less than exceptional. When I learned however, that Christian Bale would play John Connor, my attention was grabbed. Suddenly I wanted to see it. So, saw it in the theatre and not only was it good, it was great! To my additional suprise Sam Worthington (whom I had never seen before) in my opion was as good (if not better than) Christian Bale in his role as Marcus Wright. His character was so believable, you find yourself cheering him on, wanting him to survive. MCG did an excellent job with this movie! By the time the credits rolled, I was hoping MCG and Bale would team up for another go. I pre-ordered the DVD I liked it that much!
 Great movie, great price. I really like the movie, I went to see it in theatres and then bought this one. The video quality is amazing and the movie is awesome. No regrets.
 We rented the movie (video on demand) and loved it. We stopped it 45 minutes into the movie to refresh our drinks.....it felt like only 15 minutes had passed. Definitely worth the rental !
 I saw it thinking it was going to be so terrible. Do not listen to reviewers. They think it was terrible. I liked it better than the originals. The action was great, storyline was actually pretty good, and the acting was terrific. I only found it to be a little short because I didn't want it to stop.  Action
 Im am a huge Terminator fan, and have seen all the movies more than twice, and I have to say this is the BEST of the whole series!!! The movie is action packed and has a sloid plot, with many twists and turns, that leave you guessing throughout the whole movie. Christian Bale And Sam Worthington in my opinion both played an excillent role in the movie. I won't really tell the plot for those of you who have never seen it, but all i'll say is that it takes place a few years after Terminator 3, and Skynet has terminated half of the human race, now creating different types, and models of Terminators to destroy those who survived the deadly attack, now called the Resistance. Buit when Skynet produces it's deadlyest Terminator model yet, the fate of the world is again in the hands of John Connor, and a few freinds, oh and lets just say...lol....Arnold's Back. 5/5!
 this is a great movie, of course it is not a james cameron movie, it is not supposed to be!!! but it was so much more entertaining than the other terminators. we loved it, promise you will not be dissapointed, cool action futuristic movie!!
 AWESOME addition to the series 
 this movie is the best ever seen. we been waiting a long time for this particular moment. and now its here.
 product was in excellent condition. shop with confidence. would buy from this seller again.
 Blu Ray is the only way to watch this movie...excellent sound with surround sound setup and the picture is extra crisp.
 MY FAMILY AND I LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS THE BEST ONE YET..FULL OF ACTION AND ENTERTAINMENT.. TWO THUMBS UP..
 I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines. He finds out that he is on Skynet's hit list along with his father, Kyle Reese, who is a teenager. Marcus is back and meets Kyle and Star. They try to get to John Connor, but Kyle and Star are captured by a machine and taken prisoner. Marcus reaches John and his crew to tell him about Kyle. We soon find out that Marcus is a terminator who thinks he is human. Marcus helps John by going into the heart of Skynet's headquarters and disable its defenses so John can save Kyle Reese and the other prisoners. They must battle some tough Terminators in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TERMINATOR SALVATION!!!
 Terminator Salvation is an extremely beautiful action movie. We finally get an entire movie based around the future war. Not only do we get to see the classic terminators, but we get a ton of fascinating new implements of Skynet. Watching this movie on Blu-Ray will be an amazing experience.
 Got this DVD some time ago from Amazon but wasn't able to review it until now.  The director's cut is not much different then the regular version but the extras are very nice additions. I'd reccomend this to anyone who liked the film but have not bought the DVD.
 Some spoilers follow...  I really expected a bad movie considering it was "Charlie's Angels McG at the helm, but it actually had the same "B movie feeling the other three had...he could use a little help in the story editing department (the flow was a little clunky here and there...almost like stuff was missing), but the script seemed solid enough to me. Like most movies these days, I'm sure there is a great deal of footage on the floor so to speak, that could end up being an extended version of this that could possibly clarify things a bit.  The production was outstanding...this will a great demo disc on BR, especially with the sound design...very layered and intense. The special effects were great and everything from sets to make-up to costumes and photography was a step up from the earlier films, giving it an epic feel. It has a gritty look to the action that suits the setting and story perfectly. The physical action were really well done...again, adding an intense realism to the movie without being over the top.  Stand-outs include the sensational "Harvester chase scene and both times Conner is in a chopper...watch out!  Another surprise here is the choice of Danny Elfman, and his score sounds quite good...a little too reminiscent of his work on Marky Mark's Ape flick maybe, but it still works none the less....he gives the music a more traditional orchestral sound opposed to the over-use of synthesizers that many action films rely on these days. It was cool to hear Fidel's main motif pop in once in a while at just the right times. There's an interesting recurring motif for the Marcus character that reminds me of Ron Grainer's work on "The Omega Man", further adding to that cool `70's apocalyptic vibe that parts of this movie has.  Now the cast...as mentioned by many other reviews, this is definitely Sam Worthington's show...the story invests a lot of time in Marcus' journey through the film an it helps that Worthington does a really good job with his physical performance (especially with those little nods to Arnold's "stillness along the way) and he comes across well acting-wise too. I found his struggle with what he really was provided the most poignant moments in the movie...a man trapped in a new existence as a Terminator, fighting to stay connected with his flawed humanity and looking for some kind of redemption for his own past and ending up providing a "salvation for the resistance and it's new leader....cool stuff and an interesting twist on the whole "Terminator story.  Bale was almost a supporting actor in this thing...he was competent, but not outstanding. Again, his role could have been sabotaged by the script and the editing as much as anything... Compared to Marcus, Bale's John Conner seemed a little one-note with his performance throughout the film. Could be considered the nature of his character here but... There were some cool moments with him though, like when he pops on that GnR tune before capturing the MotoTerminator that brought back memories of the Connor character's motorbike stunts in T2. I also liked that it was pretty clear that not everyone in the resistance (most notably the higher-ups) though he was "all that", but the grunts in the trenches did...gave him an everyman appeal that was pretty cool.  Another show-stealer was Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese...this young man is proving to be quite the chameleon as an actor this summer, first in "Star Trek as the precocious boy-genius Chekov and now here he is almost literally channeling Michael Biehn (right down to talking through clenched teeth) as the young resistance fighter Reese.  Both of the female characters are a little short-shifted here, but both Howard and Bloodgood do a good job in the brief scenes they have.  Like the recent "Star Trek picture, this one had a lot of visual nods (and some obvious lines) to the earlier films, from the cool opening credits looking similar to the ones the first film to a lot of physical gags from other movies as well, especially with Marcus. The action sequences were well-staged and packed some punch. And yes, the Arnold cameo featured some excellent work from ILM...very well integrated both visually and in the story....very cool. The ending? Well, I'll just leave it at...I like what the film presented way better than the "leaked one....yeah, maybe it seemed a little sappy to some, but I though it fit well.  The main thing that really shines though in this movie for me is that it really looks like an effort by folks that really cared about the Terminator saga and wanted to do a great job. As with any of these "franchise movies, there are always fans who disagree with the approach taken with the film or story elements or casting choices or whatever. But it works great for me...I hope this movie finds a big, receptive audience on DVD and Blu-Ray...  But...if this ends up being the end of the line for the Terminator saga (and the slowing domestic BO suggests it might be)...it's a good one, but I'm game for more...
 I just don't get the negative reviews. I refused to watch it because of the many bad reviews. I finally decided to watch it last night. I was expecting a lousy flick. What a pleasant surprise. This movie is great. Almost as good as the first Terminator but definately better than parts two and three. If you don't like this movie you just can't appreciate originality and great action. 10 STARS OUT OF 10!
 Already had a DVD of this movie...bought the Blu ray for the improved video quality.  I was not disappointed. The video quality on this Blu ray is excellent and consistent throughout the movie (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV).  Highly recommend if you are looking for improved video quality.
 I have been hooked on the Terminator series since the 1st and this one did not disappoint at all.  Special effects and the acting were excellent!  Christain Bale never lets me down - he has become one of my favorite actors ever since American Psycho.
 I have not been ale to watch the movie. The seller clearly posted this as HD, but I was too dumb to know the difference. I have no way to play this disc but that's all on me. The seller posted it correctly. I was just to hurried and did not pay attention. Since it's my error, I never asked about returning it. I'll try to resell it or just donate it if I have too.
 awesome film, better then T3 and problem was storylines but this was doing the writer strike, other then that awesome movie
 Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
 It goes without saying that the "best Terminator film was the first, simply because it *was* the first! There is something to be said for originality, after all. Still I am far more impressed with "Terminator Salvation for a couple of reasons
 If you like the Terminator Series, this movie is a must. It is a very good story line with excellent effects. There's only one part of the movie that I thought was a little "cheesy, but that's my opinion. I know what the reasoning behind it was, but I think it was just unnecessary. I won't say what it is because I do not want to spoil it.
 To the action lover this movie will be greatly appreciated. I think that even those who are not so much impressed with action films will like this one.
 They finally changed it up from the "a new terminator is trying to kill you and I'm here to protect you scenario.  Good special effects and good story to entertain.
 Christian Bale out did himself as John Conner in this 4th extension of the Terminator Saga with a Dark side never seen before! There was no mercy or compassion for the proto type Terminator Marcus Right until that proto type gave up his life for John Conner. I was completely surprised at the ending of this movie and amazed at its impact on my own thinking!  Excellent story line and drama with the best visual effects seen since T-2  Th<a href="http
 Wow, Terminator Salvation is actually a really exciting movie!  I went in already a big fan of the original three Terminator films, but Terminator Salvation really does a fantastic job continuing with the series.  It's not a secondrate or cheesy attempt in comparison to the previous three Terminator films either- it's actually really darn good.  I admit I mostly like the Terminator films because, well first of all, they are action-packed in a way that's pretty easy to understand and follow.  I simply *enjoy* them.  I know what's going on.  It's not science fiction created in a completely confusing way.  The storyline is what it is- machines are designed to kill humans and take over the world.  Secondly, I feel a LOT of tension whenever I think about humans trying to run away from an enormous, dangerous machine created for the sole purpose of destroying anybody that moves.  I can't tell you how many dreams I've had where I was running and hiding as much as I could ONLY for a huge machine to suddenly show up and force me to continue running.  I love it!  As for Terminator Salvation, there's some really cool additions to the machine creatures.  I really fell in love with the robot snakes (as I like to call them, hehe).  They are actually huge metal claws that hide in the water.  Also, let's not forget the scene out in the desert with that HUGE machine that actually has motorcycles stored as a last resort inside his legs (I kid you not!).  Apparently whenever someone is out of shooting distance for this particular machine, he opens up his legs and sends machines on motorcycles after them.  Awesome!  The storyline is typical affair however.  You *know* what to expect.  There's nothing especially hard to grasp about what's taking place.  Overall, with todays technology and the way Hollywood delivers action flicks these days, the action scenes involving the robots going ballistic is just incredible and seems more believable now than it did in years past.  The same remains true here.  Great movie.
 I went into this flick expecting a big, fat flop.  But what I got was a suspenseful, informative movie with a driving plot, exceptional acting, and a few splashes of memories of sweet days gone by.  I am SO glad that Christian Bale signed up for this one.  His presence was the kicker.  Many movies that are at the fourth installment are bashed by critics and slammed by the masses before they even reach the public eye.  These movies are destined to fail simply because they are preternaturally steeped in "sequel doom and, therefore, expected to fail.  With Christian being there, you know that the entire production team was aiming for quality, and they did not disappoint.  There were many edge-of-your seat moments and plenty of pure suspense to go around.  Even though the scene with Ah-nold in it was computer generated, it was awesome to see him again in a movie.  Actually, it was a bit bittersweet.  Because of the success of "Terminator
 Back in 2003 as I was driving with my Mom from seeing Terminator 3
 I have been waiting for a 4th Terminator film for six years, and I'm glad I finally got it! It had a great storyline, great actors, great special effects, and a great direction! In the year 2003, Marcus Wright is on death row and sign his body over to Skynet for medical research. 15 years later, John Connor is the leader of the Resistance against the machines.

 (**Contains minor spoilers**)  First off, this is not Arnold's Terminator. If you're expecting the same thing as the first three, you'll be disappointed by this movie. Nor is it a serious philosophical work. It is simply a continuation of the first three, from a somewhat different -- but not contradictory -- light.  The story follows John Connor and Marucs Wright, two very different individuals whose fates nonetheless seem intertwined. Connor leads a raid against one of Skynet's prisoner-holding facilities; in the process, many die. Connor makes it out alive, but so does someone else...Wright, who was being held in the facility, emerges a few minutes after Connor is extricated. Thus begins a long, twisted path on which both men embark. Along the way, they find themselves on the same team -- often doubting the other's intentions -- and yet at odds when the dark secret of Wright's resurrection -- after his execution before Judgment Day -- comes to light.  Meanwhile, they learn that Skynet is using them both to ensnare Connor as well as Kyle Reese, in order to manipulate history in their own favor; at the same time, Skynet is manipulating the Resistance itself, offering up a sort of "Trojan Horse in order to take out high command.  There are many twists and turns along the rocky road to "Salvation -- personal, and of the Resistance -- but both men make the journey. In the end, one will sacrifice all to give the other a chance at life.  Now, aside from my brief retelling (trying not to give away too much), my opinion. It's very well done, and highly enjoyable, to me at least. Obviously, there are many who disagree. But I enjoyed the twists and turns, and actually saw the movie several times while it was playing at my local theater. Would I recommend seeing it before you buy it? Yes, if for no other reason because so many are so disappointed in it. I, however, think it is one of the best, if not the best, in the series -- certainly better than 2 and 3 imho. Keep in mind that my parents were from the generation that saw and loved the first two in theaters, and I'm not; and, frankly, I don't know how much my Dad -- who loved the first -- would care for this one. I approach this having seen the first two around when T3 (which I wasn't terribly fond of) came out.  Also, this is best seen more than once to make certain that you catch everything; for a "light movie (which it certainly is), it tends to jump about, and make sudden detours. Not unpleasantly, to me at least, but there it is. My advice? See it with an open mind, and don't expect a masterpiece. If you do, you might like it; I personally thought it was awesome.
 "Terminator Salvation is the beginning of a new saga in the "Terminator franchise which begun in 1984 with James Cameron's hit "The Terminator". Directed by McG, this takes place fifteen years after the events of "Terminator
 After seeing so many really-bad and so-so "blockbuster movies recently, I was extremely pleased with this one.  Highly recommended.  Oh, the blu-ray treatment is top-notch too.
 good cast, good story, great effects. good to watch in order..   ... ... ... ... .... .... ... ... ..
 Outstanding; much more substance compared to other Terminators; acting on a much higher level due to Christian Bale.  The most satisfying of all, now for Terminator-Victory!
 I almost didn't watch this movie because I could never stomach Christian Bale & by the time I was finished watching it, I had totally changed my mind about him!! I now LOVE him but especially adore Sam Worthington!! This was top notch special effects & amazing acting by all in the movie. The story line was fantastic and well written also. I think I have watched this at least 20 times already and I never get sick of it! I totally recommend this to add to your "Terminator collection.
 Terminator salvation is one of the best movies. I was happy to find it avaliable to download. I watch it almost every week.
 It is what you would expect, but in a good way, for those who are interested in the action/drama genre
 I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen.  I still love it now.  Great movie, ton of action and great acting.  If you love buying action movies, this one is one to buy.
 The emphasis on story may be gone but the gritty style of this movie will leave you yearning for a more worthy succesor to the terminator films.
 I just finished watching this movie with hubby an hour ago for the first time. I never seen or new there was a Terminator 4. I just new about Terminator 1 and 2. When I looked up 1 and 2 to order off of Amazon I found out about 3 and 4. I now have all 4 Terminators. I've been watching each one in order the past few days. And I think Terminator 4 is a good movie. I don't think it is the best Terminator. The 3rd Terminator is the best one, but I enjoyed it just as much as the other three.
 This video is awesome. Remy, Juelz Santana, and Ne-Yo perform their hip-hop and R&B hits at The Roseland Ballroom in NYC and tears up the stage. There are also many new talented artists who are interviewed and music videos. I love The Spot Review show! It's like a breath of fresh air. If you are tired of seeing the same faces in the music industry on TV, you need to check out this show.
 Beethoven Symphonies Nos. 4 & 7, Coriolan Overture Vladimir Jurowski, conductor Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment Theatre des Champs-Elysees EuroArts Blu-ray Disc  In my opinion, this disc illustrates once again why Maestro Jurowski is earning a reputation as one of the premier orchestra and opera conductors of today.  The three Beethoven works performed on this disc are examples of classical music-making at its very best, with tempos and dynamic shadings that are spot on.  In addition, the use of period instruments and a small-scaled orchestra provide listeners a clarity of detail, textures, colors, and harmonies that are quite beautiful.  Noteworthy also are those occasional passages where the tympani and/or horns are featured.  In these particular passages, these accent instruments are heard to better advantage than one normally encounters, and the effect is impressive.  And finally it should be pointed out that the introduction (and subsequent playings) of the main theme of the last movement of the 7th symphony are truly wonderful.  This is primarily due to the violinists use of a style of bowing known as (I think) "spiccato"---a bowing technique that gives the music a bit more "bite and definition than one usually hears.  To me, hearing the theme played this way is exactly the way it was meant to be heard.  Both the picture and sound quality of this Blu-ray disc are excellent.
 From the very first bars of the Coriolan Overture, it is apparent that this is Beethoven at his very best. Vladimir Jurowski and his absolutely brilliant Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment give us a new reading of old favorites that may well blow you out of your chair. There is plenty to discover
 This is a sharply etched set of Beethoven works as played by an orchestra using instruments typical of Beethoven's period under the firm and disciplined direction of the young Russian conductor Vladimir Jurowski.  Many will associate Jurowski with successful performances of opera where there is generally a strong dramatic impulse to the interpretations, frequently up-tempo choices of speeds and generally tight control. This often leads to exciting results within the theatre world. The question therefore must be, how does he fare in standard concert works such as these?  In my opinion he does very well indeed and along expected lines. The concert starts with a grippingly taut performance of the Coriolan Overture. This is followed by an equally tight and dramatic account of the 4th symphony with sharp articulation from the orchestra at generally crisp speeds. Drama is accentuated by prominent timpani with hard sticks and cuttingly forceful brass. This is not a comfortable concept, but Beethoven himself was not a comfortable character either.  The concert concludes with a strikingly dramatic performance of the popular 7th symphony that follows all the previous characteristics with the exception of the speed chosen for the last movement. This `apotheosis of the dance' is taken at a relatively steady speed which, on first hearing, came as rather a disappointment to me - but definitely not to the rapturous audience. However upon further hearing it became clear that the chosen speed, which was adhered to with remarkable consistency, was exactly right in enabling the vital concluding bars with blaring horns to truly hit home with precise articulation and power - the overwhelming effect that Beethoven surely had in mind at the time of writing.  So for me this is a very fine and convincing disc of `period' Beethoven performances. Taken on its own terms it is probably unlikely to be bettered in terms of drama, accuracy of performance and period style. It is certainly a far cry from the alternative viewpoint taken by Thielemann with the VPO for example. There should perhaps be room for both concepts.  The recording is exceptionally fine in so far as the sound fully captures the energetic `rawness' of the intended sound. This is backed up by dramatically sympathetic camera work that manages to be detailed without being invasive.  In my opinion therefore, this warrants the full 5 stars. However, if you like Beethoven to be big and sumptuous you may not like it and would be best advised to search elsewhere for musical satisfaction.
 There are of course numerous authoritative readings of the pieces recorded in this DVD. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, however, is a period instrumental ensemble.  There are some people who adamantly refuses to accept any 'period' performance of Beethoven's grand symphonies. I approachded this disc with reservation myself, but the performance as recorded quickly dispelled any of my remaining concern. The recorded sound is very good.  I first played the disc without viewing, and was rapturous of the accoustics, and much more so as I listened further by the performance. Jurowski has a good credential as an opera conductor.  He is in charge currently of the Glyndebourne Festival, and has conducted at Italy, Germany, USA, and at large opera houses, even the MET, all to critical acclaim. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this musician's strength lies not only in opera.  The wonderful pianist Sviastoslav Richter began his pianistic career doing piano rehearsals for opera houses.  Nobody termed the legendary Richter an 'opera pianist'.  What is in the operas, often goes into a composer's instrumental music, W A Mozart is a clear example to boot. The conducting of Jurowski is clearly dramatic, but at the same time totally idiomatic. You will not find a Beethoven that is like Wagner. Having watched him live, Vladimir is clearly one of those 'conducting before the music' conductors. For young conducting talents, the No. 7 Symphony here reminds me of Guido Cantelli's own stereo recording of this masterpiece, a performance that is totally youthful and energised.  Jurowski and the OAE comes really close to that legendary reading.
 This documentary is very interesting and I recommend it. It does a good job of showing the lives of various trans-men. It deals with the struggles they each had to face as parents transitioning from female to male and mommy to daddy.
 I think this is the most underrated movie I know of. And I frankly don't understand why it's not a major hit readily available on DVD. It's very well directed and cast -- I especially like Giancarlo Giannini (sp?), but Conti and Olmos and others were great too. However, the real power of the movie derives from the quality of Celia Gittelson's story. It's intelligent, warm-hearted, deep, and very funny. I watch it on sad evenings before I fall off to sleep, and life's not so bad.  I can't help using this as a forum to explain what I see in the movie.  The Pope grows heavy from being an abstraction -- longs to return to the life of a priest where he can do some concrete good for concrete people. And suddenly he finds himself with an opportunity to wander in the world incognito.  This of course leaves room for all kinds of hysterical lines by people who don't know who he is ("You can go straight to hell. Who do you think you are? or "Maybe he's a priest? "Naw, a priest would tell us we go to hell for this."), and how his friends at the Vatican try to cover for him ("You got a job?... With all due respect, your Holiness, can't these villagers sort their own rags?")  And there's one concrete thing that he wants to do. He -- the most significant -- is guided to it, by one of the most insignificant a deaf girl from a small village (Isabella) who has taken the step of leaving her home to find him... and this act somehow demands that he respond.  It's the story of how the Christ figure (who I regard as our own true self) comes to earth and lives among us; how he works; what doubts, fears and confusions he has; what matters to him; what effect he has on various types of people. It's an explanation of the mechanism whereby mankind is redeemed.  The mechanism is to go to a place where people are defeated, take on some arbitrary project which represents a positive step, and simply act. The extent to which you know what you're doing is irrelevant. What matters is the intention.  The Pope chooses in this defeated village to rebuild the aqueduct. He knows nothing about construction. And as none of the important people -- the adult males -- will help, he gets his help from those whom society deems insignificant -- orphaned children, widows.  And then you see the incredibly venomous and destructive reaction which his actions evoke in the negative forces in the society. They begin by burning the partially reconstructed aqueduct. At this point Isabella's beautiful, sane and soulful mother -- with whom he is falling in love -- asks him, "So what are you going to do? "I'll build it again. "He'll just burn it again. "So I'll build it again. And when he comes back, I'll be here. I'll be waiting for him.  It maybe sounds stupid, but on several occasions in life, I've felt defeated -- my actions seem to be in a void, no one notices -- and this movie somehow helps me to get off my duff and 'rebuild the aqueduct'... restore my faith that my intention is heard somewhere in the ether, even if I can't see the results.  I find myself these days also relating the film to world politics. It's an essentially European film, and it restores my faith somehow that despite all their criticism of the US these days, Europe does understand the mechanism of nihilism and restoration. Europe too is on some level understandably defeated. And for all her doubts and failings, I believe the US is a positive force in the world...  The second attempt to burn is headed off by his band of ophaned boys whose allegiance the Pope has usurped from the main bad guy (Olmos). In the third burning, the incredibly charming leader of the gang is killed. He's the sacrificial lamb which spreads the Pope's intentions among the community as a whole. The Pope now feels defeated, but the community fills in.  And then there's the one town drunk, Abalardi, who lives on the outskirts, tends sheep, and is the only one who recognizes the Pope for who he really is. ("Please excuse the sheep. They see so few Popes... They fired you or what? "No, I hadn't thought of that. No, they didn't fire me. Maybe God did... "I can put your mind to rest on that... there's no such person.") Abalardi has the best role, and it's acted perfectly. At last the Pope asks, "Who are you, Abelardi? I can keep a secret.
 What a heartwarming, touching, perfect movie. Why doesn't someone release this gem on DVD. Don't need no special features, don't need no previews, don't need no cast bio's - just need this wonder film on DVD!
 I SAW THIS FILM AS A CHILD AND IT IS ONE OF THE FILMS I AM MOST FOND OF.  IT IS RARE FOR A MOVIE TO LIVE IN THE THOUGHTS OF SOMEONE FOR SO LONG BUT I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ONE DAY I WOULD FIND A COPY FOR MYSELF.  TRULY A GREAT FILM.
 This film is not just a must see, it is a must own.  You will definitely want to bring out this film over and over to see again.  From its creative, unique plot, funny lines, irony, beautiful scenery, marvelous acting, and wonderful, not just feel-good but make-you-think message,  you will want to add this movie to your favorites list.  Saving Grace delights, inspires and gently admonishes the viewer to find and be faithful to the things in life that really matter, despite the naysayers and obstacles that mount up to try to obscure the simple good all around us.  This film is the opposite of in-your-face religion; instead it is about all of us finding the love and goodness in the rough and simple places all about us, rather than in the high places.  When I stumbled onto this movie some years back in a video store, the film quickly became a favorite, that I regularly showed to family and friends, and to youth groups.  All loved it, both the guys and the girls.  I would always bring it out Saving Grace to view when I became overwhelmed or beaten around by life.  To my great remorse, my VHS copy was lost when I loaned it out and never got it back.  That was several years ago.  Now I am on this site looking for a copy on DVD to buy, and grumbling because it doesn't seem to be available.  Once I find the DVD version, I will purchase at least 5 copies,for myself and to give as gifts to family and friends.  I hope the powers that be come to their senses and make this beautiful film available on DVD.  It also would be great to see on TV; I can imagine it becoming a recurring favorite through the years.
 This is a movie that lifts me up when I'm down.  I too wish it was on DVD.  I read through a few of the five star ratings and really liked what they had to say.  I wish more people in the world were like this.  I know of few people who are very good to other people and have charitable dispositions.  I like to watch this movie and try to live the example that was set.  Please get it made into a DVD.
 I saw this movie first in 1995 and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I love the story, the characters, the fine acting.  It is a truly a beautiful movie.  A gem.
 Story, movie and acting all come together in this movie. They sure don't make them like this any more. It's a must have. I WANT IT IN WIDE SCREEN FORMAT DVD. NOW!!!
 Tom Conti's "Saving Grace is a largely unknown, underrated movie, perhaps because it was made abroad and most of the casts were unknown actors (save Tom and a young Edward James Olmos). However, the plot of the movie and the story line was excellent.  It tells the story of a future Pope Leo XIV (played by Conti), who was isolated from his flocks, living in Vatican and surrounded by Vatican bureaucrats he had to deal with everyday. He wished that he is able to travel outside to see how his people live their lives and deal with real-life problems. One day, somewhat unexpectedly, he got his wish. He accidentally got locked out from the Vatican and decided to travel to a rural and impoverished Italian village that suffered from all the disasters and misfortune one can imagine (epidemic, unemployment, chronic poverty, failing infrastructure, etc). He decided to attempt to rekindle the spirit of the local people by (at first) single-handedly rebuild an old malfunctioning village aquaduct. Soon, he started to win followers from the young hopeless residents of the village, but he also encounters many obstacles and learnt a great deal about himself and how his ministry supposed to be like during his time in the village. This experience transforms the way he conducts his Petrine ministry in many ways.  This is a must see movie for Catholics (or anyone for that matter) that often thought that the Pope, the bishops, and the clergymen were often out-of-touch with the concerns and problems of lay Catholics. I wish the experiences of Leo XIV could happen more often in real life and transform the way Popes and bishops govern the Church. But till then, you should watch this movie, enjoy it, and pray that the transformation told in it would occur in our Church today.
 This movie is great! I have it on vhs and have watched it for years but have been waiting for an official release to dvd but it hasn't happened. When I saw that Amazon manufactures it on demand I was skeptical, but I ordered it anyway and was not disappointed in the least. The quality of this dvd is just as good as what any studio would release. So if you're hesitant in purchasing this because Amazon manufactured it, DON'T BE!  Purchase it-you won't be disappointed either!
 It literally took me years to figure out the name of this movie.  I just remember seeing and loving this movie back when I was a child.  Like the 40+ others reviewing this I say, "GIVE US A DVD OF THIS TO BUY! This is such a wonderful heart warming movie! I wish that there was some way to get it out on DVD! I've watched it many times and it always makes me  believe again in goodness in the world.
 I can in no way improve on what has been said already.  This film should be be treated as a classic that will be watched for many years to come.  PLEASE!!! get this onto DVD.  I will buy it immediately along with extra copies for others.  This is a real jewel!
 I saw this charming film on the recommendation of my brother in law. A film about a pope who gets locked out? Eeeehhhhhhhh, I dunno.  My husband and I watched it and were absolutely charmed. We have been looking for a DVD version for the last few years to add it to our library and share with our kids.  BRING THIS GEM TO DVD!
 A friend recommended this to me years ago, and when I saw the video, I loved it. Later my wife bought the VHS for me, but I hope that it will be released on DVD one day.  Although listed as a comedy--and it does have a strong humorous flavor throughout--it is a powerful drama about spiritual growth, hope, despair, love, and self respect. Reminiscent somewhat of "Shoes of the Fisherman, starring Anthony Quinn, from several years earlier, this is the story of a Pope's returning to his roots of being a pastor and helper of mankind--something he found difficult, if not impossible, to do in the Vatican. Somewhat by accident, he embarked on a spiritual journey and once again proved that he was a true priest of God.  If you haven't seen this movie, please do so. It is somewhat of a "sleeper and may be difficult to find. Quite frankly, I don't know why it didn't get more visibility.
 I remember seeing the preview to this movie when it was released in the theaters, and thinking, "Sounds Funny! Well, we may have been a little mislead by that. However, this movie shows what we all must go through at one time in our lives
 When I first saw this movie it lifted me up. If only a real Pope could be so spiritual. Lent it to a Buddhist priest and a Catholic friend and they both praised the movie, and the feelings it brought out in them.  The Giannini character says God doesn't exist but he hopes that's not true. The movie makes you believe that, if God does exist, it would be a wonderful thing. And maybe God does exist.  But it's not a religious movie, it's a movie about people and a movie that's wonderfully done . . "Full of wonder . . hmm.
 Why, oh why, doesn't this wonderful, family, heart-warming film appear on DVD? It is a gem for any day of the week. Ponti is a wonderful Pope (and I am Methodist).  Please, pleeeeeeze, bring out in DVD format. My VHS format is old and yellow..... and fuzzy.
 Wonderful movie of a young pope (for a pope) who feels he has become inaffective and sneaks off to find his way.
 I was very thankful to find this movie. It's one of my favorites. Catholic or not, you'll enjoy this touching movie.
 I had seen this movie many years ago and lost track of who had it in my family. I decided I needed to see it again. It was worth more than I paid. Rare to see a non-religious "religious film. With warmth and humor the story of Pope Leo and the defeated village of Monte Petra reaffirms the value of elegance in story telling and the power of great and honest acting to move the soul. The humanity rooted in love, even when love can be a hard pill to swallow, can and in this case does, inspire. Tom Conti's character in very human,striving to cope with almost superhuman responsibilities. His "escape to find his people allows him to find himself again...and his spiritual Guide. Enjoy this one with your family!
 I am soooo excited that this movie is FINALLY available on DVD!  If I could own only 3 or 4 movies - this would definitely be one of them.  Heartwarming, subtle humor and a great story.  Catholic, non Catholic - it doesn't matter - you'll love the story.  Don't Miss it!
 I taped this film from TV some time ago and have watched it over and over. It's funny and heartwarming. Conti and Giannini give wonderful performances.
 A long lost gem, this is such a wonderful movie! Tom Conti is perfect as the Pope who's accidentally locked out of the Vatican and finds a purpose in helping a small town escape from the evil seduction of dependency on government handouts.
 I Just finished watching SAVING GRACE,for the 4th or 5th time. A moving, funny, enjoyable and inspiring film with an incredible cast headed by Tom Conti, along with Giancarlo Gianinni, Fernando Rey, Erland Josephson and others. Who would have thought a movie about THE POPE could be this human. See it.
 I am very happy with this purchase.  The tape artrived in good time.  The movie arrived in a nearly perfect box and the tape was also in very good shape.  I was very pleased.
 I bought this for a friend because it is one of my favorite movies ever!
 This movie will engage you from beginning to end. All of the characters are complex and each is very convincingly portrayed. It's appeal is not an overly sentimental presentation of the "old god becomes human theme. Instead it takes a man who happens to be pope and allows him to temporarily abandon the vestments of his position. The central character has all the flaws of any man and makes mistakes that in some instances result in trajedy. Tom Conti's performance is outstanding. His character is both passionate and sensitive but like the rest of us struggles to make the right decisions and take the best action. The results are not predictable. You will laugh and cry but above all else it will challenge your views of what constitutes good and evil. And in the end...(I'll let you decide).
 All this time, I thought I was the only who loved this movie as much as you do.  I had a copy of this movie at one time and was so eager for my friends to see it, I loaned it to a preacher when he had surgery and I never saw the movie again and he joined the Navy and moved to Spain.  Ever since, I have been looking for this movie on DVD.  What a disappointment that it isn't on DVD.  Whenever I think of the movie, I can't help but smile.  It has such true meaning for humanitarian causes.  Please keep me posted when it comes out on DVD (if ever).  I am so glad there is a Saving Grace following!
 This is a wonderful family film that is way too hard to find.  Video stores should continue to carry it.  I'm so glad to have this video in my collection.  Every family should.
 What a gem this film is! A true delight for the whole family! With lessons on morality, modest humor, and triumphant hope amid the struggle against oppression and despair, this film is a treasure to be watched repeatedly!  The acting, writing, and direction are all excellent. The cinematography and location scenes are all beautiful! My only problem with the film is that its translataion onto tape caused it to jiggle on the screen. Maybe that's because the tape was used and old. I do not know. Nonetheless, when and if it comes out on dvd I intend to buy at least two copies.
 I ordered the movie "Amazing Grace with Tom Conti and Retro Rocket Entertainment has been excellent to deal with. they were prompt in answering my concerns and very good about helping me with my concerns. they are excellent to do business with and I would recommend them highly.
 I rented this movie a couple of time a few years back. It is funny and a real faith builder too.  It is a shame that the film is out of print and was never put on a DVD.  In the meantime, I can still enjoy it on my trusty VHS player.  I strongly recommend that you scoop up one of the last copies of the movie still available
 What a wonderful, heart warming movie. Not to be confused with another movie of the same name starring Craig Ferguson. Tom Conti gives an exceptional performance as Pope Leo who, inadvertantly, lives among the common people. What a movie! Great seller
 I had been looking for this movie for a long time. I'am so glad I got it. What a great story.
 For the most part, surfing movies only subtly delve into the totally experience of surf adventures.  You may see an airport scene here, and a flat tire on the rental car there.  But viewers may not get the full essence of a real surfing adventure.  Endless Summer II is a tremendous mix of awesome footage at beautiful breaks, interesting experiences from the cast, and delightful break from the typical surf film.  If you have any bit of surfing blood in you, you will be extremely pleased with this pick.
 Know what I did the other day?  Woke up with the theme song from Endless Summer in my head. It was snowing up and down the east coast, so I popped in Endless Summer II (on VHS - still waiting for that DVD), turned up the heat, cracked open a couple Coronas with my roommate, and instantly was back in the sun, on the beach, in the kind of place where deeply spiritual connection to people and place combines with waves and nice looking girls in bikinis (or less if you're in Biaritz, Fr.), the kind that only comes from surfing. The thing about this movie
 This movie is pure goofy fun.  Great footage of surfers doing their thing in some of earth's most beautiful places.  The humor is so goofy and cheesy that you can't help laughing and cheering your way through the movie.  On a winter's night after playing all day in the snow, O'Connell and Weaver are the perfect guides to endless summer fun......
 This is a great surfing film that shows the lives of surfers, both what they do and who they are. I highly recommend this flick for anyone who has ever surfed or thought about riding a wave. Once again Bruce Brown has out done himself.
 That's a good movie with a good storie and good surfing. I've just seen it once and I don't know how many times I will watch before being bored.
 Awesome video, great videography and humorous narration of two young men who trek the globe, catching waves during an "endless summer of fun and adventure.
 It is hard to improve on the original, but this DVD comes real close.  Any surf film can show good waves, but what separates ES II is Bruce Brown's narrative (reminiscent of ES), the characters, and how this movie flows.  There is enough non-surf events going off that it stays fresh from start to finish.  Add this one to the collection, and hope that the formats don't change too soon.
 I've made it a personal tradition to watch this movie during spring break each year throughout high school.  It always gets me excited about summer.  I HIGHLY recommend this film for anybody who loves to travel to new places.  The guys in this film have the opportunity to go to several exotic places that most people wouldn't even consider for vacationing.  But each place has its own charm and appeal, and the surfers are able to have a blast wherever they end up.  Great film all around.  Awesome surfers, awesome waves, awesome producer.  Simple as that.
 Simply the most classic surf video ever!  Certainly a "must have for any respectful surfer
 this is perhaps the greatest surfing documentary of all time. i thought no one could top the endless summer I, but clearly i was wrong.
 If you enjoyed Endless summer I then this is a must. This movie  captures the atmosphere of the surf scene and makes you want to just get out there and go for it. The steps of the Endless summer I characters are retraced and new exciting locations visited and surfed. A healthy dose of humour is thrown in as well
 The sequel to  The Endless Summer  has much better surf footage than the original and I think that the soundtrack is a tad better than the first as well...but both movies are excellent...makes you wonder when they will do  The Endless Summer 3  !!! Take me along for the third installment !
 I rented this video for my 13 and 15 year old sons and their friends everyday for an entire summer! I kept thinking, "this is the last time they'll want to see it NOT SO! I could have saved a bundle if I'd just purchased it the first day. I made a joke about putting it on a loop so it would never go off. I did not tire of having it on because the music is pleasant, the narration smooth, charactors likable and the scenery & surfing breathtaking. We've since purchased a couple of copies each of Endless Summer 1 and 2 (along with movie posters). The boys are 16 and 19 now and we still love the videos. One son took a special detour to Biaritz France, just to see where they surfed.
 Endless Summer II is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen! If you are into surfing, or even if your not, CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT! It is well worth your time and is the best surfing movie ever. I have been surfing for four years and this movie perfectly conveys the emotions, sights and sounds of surfing. Excellent sound and music, A+ cinematography, some of the best scenery caught on a surfing movie ever, and some of the most influential surfers in the world such as Pat O'Connel and Robert Weaver ever to grace a surfing movie, make this movie a definate keeper.  Bottom Line
 No other surf video has caught the soul of surfing like ES II!  Of course it has unbelievable surf footage...it also has unbelievable surfers...then you add in the adventure of an around the world trip...but the thing that makes this movie special is it captures the passion that we as surfers have for the awesome power and majesty of the ocean.  Any video can show some nifty moves that the beachcomber would be blown away by...but here for all to see is unveiled a small glimpse into the unique world of the surfer.  Here, unveiled, is a peek at what drives each one of us to paddle back out to the break, day after day, and what makes surfing the most spectacular, addicting, adrenaline pumping sport in the world!  Anyone from a 3 decade veteran to a Kansas farmer will enjoy this landmark movie. ES II follows 2 surfers from cali as they make their quest for the endless summer around the world.  Along the way they visit costa rica, france, africa, australia, and s.pacific.  Their are huge days at jaws in Hawaii, cold days in Alaska, never ending waves at jeffries in S.Africa...all topped off by a bear encounter, a croc chase, and some class 5 rapids.  If you want adventure than this is your movie.  If you want beautiful photography than once again this is for you.  Great movie!  Don't miss it!
 This is a very good movie with some excellent surfing footage with both long and short boards. The movie does a great job of capturing the same feeling of the original 1964 movie with a more modern updated feel. I really appreciated the shortboard footage in this movie along with the humorous narration. This movie is a must-own if you are a surfer or anyone that appreciates the soul and art of the sport.
 If you are a surfer who is stoked to see some great surfers riding the best waves in the world, this movie is made for you.
 This is the coolest movie that I have seen in a long time. I saw it about 2 years ago and I still think that it is my favorite movie of all time.  Even if you don't surf it is a fun movie to watch. It had great camera shot  and humor. The parts in Australia are the best in my opinion. I lve the  seen with the smallest wave too.
 The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly.  The good is the all that is surfing, which this movie is all about.  The bad  is Hollywood's corporate stranglehold on creativity.  The ugly is all those  amateur movie  reviewers, myself included.  However, most don't know the true (behind the  scenes)  production and post-production struggles between the surfers  involved in the project and the funding &amp; distribution company, which  suffocated many talents. There was some pain involved. Yet despite all the  struggles, an incredible and entertaining 35mm surf documnetary was made,  and should be seen all.
 If you surf, or want to surf, or just like the ocean, then get this video. Great footage of some awesome waves(breaks) and also a KILLER sountrack as well. Gary Hoey and Dick Dale. Cant go wrong with that! I just wish they  would release it on DVD now....
 The video show some of the best  surfers and breaks ever.  The footage is great.  Some of the best surf in the world.
 I would have to disagree that this is better than the original. I'm not saying that it is bad, because that would be blasphemy, but the orginal still remains my favorite.
 One of my fav Chris Walken movies, Communion. Not a typical sci-fi or alien movie by any means but the kind I like. Based on supposed true alien encounters, but not promising to be real as the case with this new crap like The Fourth Kind. One of the last true great alien films of the 80s/90s era. The only other alien film I really enjoy besides this one is Fire In The Sky which goes along similar lines as this film. The story of a man who is abducted by aliens but hasn't realized/come to terms with it until he uncovers this truth in psycho analysis. A true wonder and definitely a defining role for Chris Walken.
 Communion is a terrifically atmospheric sci-fi that scared the wits out of me. I found the scene in the woods with the lights to be all too familiar. I heard that Walken was and is a total non-believer. He's sure a great actor. When he was scared trick or treating I jumped out of my skin. Needless to say, I highly recommended this alien abduction movie that's based on the alleged true recollections of Whitley Strieber. Watch it and see if it rings any bells.
 The movie closely follows the book some say its a hoax a lie or imagination.I say lets find out great story 80's dated style but an overall bizarre account
 What an absolutely thought-provoking movie... period. Whitley Strieber's euphoric experiences shapes our lives in ways that we could never have imagined. Movies are almost always difficult to be made and expressed in the same way as are books, but the awesome Christopher Walken pieces it together in the most brilliant way. His acting is superb. To see Christopher Walken portray the full range of emotions that overtakes an abductee such as Whitley Striber is to see his greatest acting skills ever! Make no doubt about it, Communion brings forth to the attention of everybody watching it, the fundamental questions of life that we have all been looking for.
 This is a movie about the true abduction experience of Whitley Strieber and his family at his upstate New York cabin. This is a really good dramatization of his experiences. Anyone interested in the subject of UFOs should have a copy in his collection. Highly Recommended!
 This was a great movie; and introduced the dynamic acting of Christopher Walken to me.  It also scared the you-know-what out of me.  I must have seen this movie a dozen times and still get scared each time.  If you've ever had even a remotely similar experience as what is depicted in this movie, you'll be leaving the lights on at bedtime guaranteed.
 I love this movie. Yes it is definitely a B-movie, but as a B-movie I think it's one of the great ones.  It comes from the era when Mad Max and the Road Warrior were all the rage and so has the same "lost in a decaying forbidden zone kind of feel.  After trying to be a serious actor and starring in things like the TV mini-series "Rich Man, Poor Man", Peter Strauss' career obviously stalled, as by 1983 he was reduced to starring in B-grade fare like this. And Molly Ringwald, fresh from "The Facts of Life and prior to her becoming the 80s teen movie queen, has never been more annoying -- which is just what the script called for her to be
 Yes, that's right
 This movie freaking rules. When I was a kid it was on every time I was sick home from school, on public TV, at about noon. It was very consistent. I TRUST THIS MOVIE. Buy it. It will always be there for you in times of need and is perfect with soup and kleenex and a couch.
 The movie has a good story line.  The actors do a great job.  Special effect (for 1983) are good.  I saw this when it came out in theaters.  This was the first movie I watched with Molly Ringwald and became an instant fan.  I am glad I added it to my collection.
 Eureka!  I have had a VHS tape of this classic sci-fi movie for a long time.  I've been a sci-fi fan my whole life.  I'm also a long time fan of Peter Strauss.  So how could I not love this movie!!  I was ecstatic when I stumbled over the DVD while going through Amazon recommendations for my profile.  I didn't even have to think twice.  Even though some may considered it a B-movie I love watching it.  I can finally retire my VHS tape!  If you like good clean fun, action and adventure and a bit of sci-fi to boot, you'll enjoy this movie!
 This was the first movie I ever saw with Molly Ringwold.  I knew she was something special by this movie.  It's a good movie if you like Science Fiction.
 I first owned this flic on VHS tape when it first came out. I loved it! I played it many times till one of my relatives hi-graded it and destroyed it in his poorly maintained VCR. When I tryed to find another copy I couldn't; so sad. At last, Amazon, and I'm happy again! For fast paced total entertanment that doesn't require much heavy thinking this cant be beat.
 Picture a Tough-hard as nails space captain who owes more money than there is in Fort Knox...  Pay every one off, easy-just rescue three hot women from a forbidden world.  Who can he call on for help, a money hungry space-cop, a hot robot bombshell, a junker space ship that's just spare parts flying in formation, and a young survivor girl.  If you enjoy fighting mutants, rescuing damsels in distress and good one liners, here's your movie.
 This is one of my favorite movies.  I watched this way back, and I later bought the tape when the price was $25 and considered it a great value.  I still watch that movie once in a while.  It's high adventure and an all together great movie.
 After not expecting movies like  Krull  on DVD, here comes more good news.  Spacehunter  is coming to DVD on December 4! (Same day as the first Babylon 5 disc) Spacehunter will get the basic Columbia/Tristar DVD treatment
 I can't believe some of these jobs they have in the military!  Very cool  -- and dangerous stuff!  Great video!
 The picture quality is photographic and now I can hear the birds chirping at the start of Commando... bliss! Having to rent these classic movies in VHS format has hindered my full appreciation of their outstanding quality. For those like myself who are too young to have seen them on the big screen, watching Commando is a new and delightful experience. Although I am not a huge fan of violent movies, I can assure you that Commando is one of the best 'comedies' of all time with almost enough memorable quotes to rival Fawlty Towers! Running Man is my favorite of this collection only surpassed by True Lies as my favorite Arnie. And with the inclusion of Predator and Total Recall, none of the titles are 'fillers' (unlike other collections), these are all blockbusters. You'll love Commando for the commedy, Running Man for the action, Total Recall for the sci-fi, and Predator for the adrenaline rush. Other great features include
 action, Action, ACTION, and... Yes, thats right, more hard-hitting action. Arnie really knows what his audience wants. I will now review each film individually.  TOTAL RECALL. With perfect doses of Action, Sci-fi and  Special Effects, this film is a near perfect Action/Sci-fi. Arnie acting is  at its best and the supporting cast (including Sharon Stone and Ronny Cox)  are all very believable. 5 STARS. PREDATOR. Another Perfect Action/Sci-fi  (what would you expect from the director of Die Hard) Everything in it  (the Music, the cast, the sets) all combine to give the film a certain feel  (like in the alien films) The sction and violence comes hard and fast and  the special effects (by the Brilliant Stan Winston) are State-of-the-art. 5  STARS. THE RUNNING MAN. A chilling view of the world to come. Arnold is  back (as he promised to be) and in one of his most violent and exciting  movies. The bad guys are also some of the toughest Arnie has faced,  (Sub-zero and Buzz-saw to name two) and the sets are frighteningly  realistic. Might be a bit rough for some. (as with all of these movies) 5  STARS. COMMANDO. If Rambo had a Daughter, he would be Commando. This has to  have one of the highest body counts of any American Movies. Non-stop Action  and Laughs. (the laughs come from the classic lines Arnie gives, EG. When  he drops a man off a cliff and says  I let him go .)5 STARS.
 An exellent DVD, featuring all the great players of past and present, full of highlights interviews and exellent story line, describing each of an ultimate player's skill, like scoring, speed, mentality, etc. Exellent music to go with the story, and the final highlight featuring michael jordan could'nt be better (even thou I'm a Laker Fan), wich made me also order ultimate jordan eventualy.
 Talking about music, would anybody be expert (and kind) enought to help me on that 
 I got the product faster than I expected. I am very pleased with the whole process.
 While this is not your typical romance, it is in fact the differences that make this a true masterpiece. The movie starts with Roberts having a meal with her good friend and editor George. (George happens to be gay.) It is interesting that George is not ashamed of being gay, but he doesn't scream it from the rooftops either. He is to be the voice of reason in this comedy of mishaps.  Roberts is happy to get a call from her former romantic partner Michael. But this soon turns to panic when she realizes that he is marrying Kimmy. (Roberts is getting an invitation to the wedding.) George tries to calm roberts down, but to no avail. She is determined to break the wedding. Whether we are routing for Roberts or find her actions cruel, somehow we get the impression that she is fighting a doomed uphill battle.  We meet Kimmy, and we have no reason to doubt that they are a proper match. To be sure, there is one weak point that Roberts finds and exploits, but let's be fair. What relationship doesn't have some weak point?  Roberts realizes that her plans have backfired, and she desperately calls George for help. George tries to be a friend to Roberts, but his patience wears down when he sees her new plan. (Pretending she is engaged to George to make Michael jealous.) While George plays along, it is clear that he has had it with this whole thing. He nails the crux of the matter when he says
 My Best Friend's Wedding is probably Julia Roberts best romantic comedy, even better than Pretty Woman. Dermont Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, and Rupert Everett also star in this tale of a food critic played by Roberts who is invited to intend her best friend's upcoming nupitals, but the thing is she is in love with her best friend and tries everything in her power to break up the wedding. I won't give away the ending but this is actually a good and solid romantic comedy and I think everyone who decides to watch will throughly enjoy it. Good luck!
 I enjoyed this deliteful romantic comedy.I am not much of a Julia Roberts fan But I enjoyed her in this movie.
 I hold this movie close to my heart, why you may ask? Because I was going thru the same thing Julia Roberts was going thru in this movie. I was in love with someone who did not belong to me. It was a hot affair 10 years ago that ended disastrously, and I ended up the loser at the end. The lesson here is, Life Goes ON. Julia's performance was so true and honest, she always steals my heart. Great movie!
 Thanks for getting this DVD to me while I am stationed over seas.
 One of my favorite Roberts movies, and just the way I like her
 This movie was excellent.  It had comedy, love, and sad moments.  And it when totally against what I expected to happen!!  I am ashamed to say that I wanted the main guy to dump Cameron!!   All in all, a great film.  I don't own it, but I just might buy it.
 Lovely girls, handsome men, humorous, beautiful and romantic story. I do enjoy watching this movie. I like George's dialogue a lot (not because he is gay!). But I am curious about one thing and feel not so right about another. Why Michael is so attractive to those two girls? This is an unexplained point in this movie. Of course we don't need to say everything in a movie, but just from my impression of THIS man in THIS movie, I don't feel that he has more charm than any other man on this planet. While I feel George really has some charisma
 How can someone fail to love Julia Roberts in this movie?!! It is a light romantic commedy of a woman got driven by her buried emotions. She tries everything to get her lover back before he gets married... although Julia Roberts becomes evil but you can never hate her because you feel for her and you see how she trembles down! She's face to face with her lover and his sweet bride whom she have no excuse to hate except that she's marrying her lover! An internal conflict, an emotional contradiction... and a love burning her down! Oh Julia Roberts facial expressions are so touchy. In this movie you LAUGH, CRY and will enjoy it again and again!
 After a five-years Break (!!!) Julia Roberts is back! Cooler, sexier, funnier and better than ever! Julia Roberts has 5 days to get to New York, to destroy a relationship and to fall in love with the man she always loved! Does it this sound easy to you?! Well it isn't and Jules has a lot of work to do... So sit back and enjoy this review of... My Best Friend's Wedding
 This movie showcases two super talents. One being Julia Roberts and other, Rupert Everett. Surprised.. don't be.. just look out for  George  and you will know why I have been talking about Mr.Everett rather than  concentrating on praising Ms Roberts sky-high. Julia Roberts does a  brilliant job of a girl who is on the brink of falling in love(with Dermot  Mulroney) and realises it a tad too late. And then Ms. Roberts does  everything to mess up things between Dermot and Ms Diaz.  This movie is  definitely going to steal a smile from your countenance and make you giggle  like a 16-year old.  Ms Roberts enacts the role of a   desparado  with a finesse incomparable. The surprise package of  the movie is Rupert Everett in a role of Julia's Editor. He is  outstandingly funny and stylish, especially in the last scene. Of the  others, the less said the better. Dermot Mulroney is as stone faced as a  stone-aged caveman. Diaz is screechingly irritating but endearing in some  scenes. All in all, a movie that will tickle the funny bone in you.
 This movie kicks butt!  I only wish I had two friends like Micheal and George!  You can't help but smile at this movie.  The songs are awesome too-especially their own rendition of  I say a little prayer for  you .  Rupert Everett steals every scene he's in and will completly  steal your heart. You should definetly see this.
 So what if this movie doesn't have the most plausible plot! It's not supposed to. When people ask me what my favorite movie is, I tell them this one without a second's hesitation. I think I saw it 7 times at the theater.  It reminds you of the first time you told somebody you liked them and how  nervous you were. I do like the ending because it brings the movie back to  reality. You don't always win. To anyone who likes this movie, I would  suggest seeing  Fools Rush In  and  Return to Me. 
 First of all...I loved it! Talk about a film that anyone willenjoy, this is it. For those close-minded movie-goers who think thatthis film is just for  women-only  or that you should go see it  just to please your significant other , then you are completely wrong.  You will like, if not love this film. The humor is funny, the acting superb, and story believable. Julia Roberts and Dermot Mulroney are excellent as  best friends  and Rupert Everett's character will make you laugh out loud.  Anyone who has ever had a member of the opposite sex for a best friend will find that this movie hits a nerve...or should I say  funny bone . It really is like banging your elbow on a chair arm and everyone around you begins to laugh, and then you begin to laugh, but deep down inside you are saying  gosh darn it (or something similar) that really hurt .  If you think the film is going to be predictable...then think again...there are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing on the outcome. The film would be excellent for all ages.  Bottom line...call up your  ex, old or current, opposite-sex best friend , get together, go see this movie, and throughout it you can jab each other in the side and say  yep, that's something you would do ....and afterwards, you will walk away and know why you could never have married each other...for it could have ruined a  wonderful friendship .  END
 It has Julia Roberts...nothing else needs to be said. Buy it!
 THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC....IT HAS LINES THAT HAVE YOU REPEATING OVER AND OVER AGAIN....MY DAUGHTER AND I LOVE WATCHING THIS MOVIE TOGETHER...ITS A NICE FAMILY MOVIE.
 I don't understand all the fuss about Julia Roberts, she doesn't play very well and she isn't even good looking! Cameron Diaz instead is magnificiant in her role, she's totaly convincing and really beautiful. This movie deserves 5 stars mainly because she's in it. The story is quite good, it's funny at times. If you want some entertainement or you want to see Cameron Diaz, buy this movie.
 MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDDING is a hilarious romantic-comedy. Julia Roberts is truly at her best in this film as Julianne, a food critic who's long-time childhood best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) is getting married to some other woman, just when Julianne starts to have feelings for him! The woman Michael is marrying is Kimberly (Cameron Diaz), a college student with a fillthy-rich father. Julianne is hopelessly in love with Michael, so to get Michael back, Julianne must find a way to stop the wedding and make Michael fall in love with Julianne herself! She gets her partner and friend, George (Rupert Everett), to help her win over Michael. The ending is actually surprising, because you'd think Julianne wins back Michael, but she actually doesn't. So it is good to see the protagonist in a film to not get what they want in the end, but can still have a happy ending. The whole cast is absolutely superb! And one of my favorite scenes is when Julianne and George pretend that they just got engaged (George is really gay), and while meeting Kimberly's family for dinner and they ask how George proposed to Julianne, George starts singing the song "I Say A Little Prayer", and then everyone else in the cast starts joining in, except for Julianne and Michael. It's a very funny movie with a witty script. If you have not yet seen MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING, then what are you waiting for? But definitely get the special edition DVD for this movie because it's better than the other DVD. I just love MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING! Great date movie, too. A must see.
 I have always been a fan of Julia Roberts and the movies she stars in - her smile is infectious, it lights up the screen. In 1997, she made a comeback with a starring role in the romantic comedy My Best Friend's Wedding. The film went on to become one of the most successful girly movies of the whole decade, and after watching it earlier tonight on TV, it's not hard to see why. It still holds up seven years later. The comedy is fresh, funky and slick. The plot is nothing original, but it holds up brilliantly because of the film's four main stars. You have Julia Roberts, of course, who is no doubt a future Hollywood legend. Then there's Cameron Diaz in one of her best film roles - not quite topping her sexual cameo in The Mask three years earlier, but still bringing much humour to her role. Rupert Everett and Dermot Mulroney are the two main male actors and also do their roles justice.  Julia Roberts plays Julianne Potter, a fast-talking confident Chicago food critic who used to date Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney) in their college days. They since broke up after nine years and moved apart. They made a pact, however, that if by the age of 28 they both were not married, then they would marry each other. When Julianne receives a call from Michael three weeks before that pact deadline, she assumes he is ringing to get back with her. However, Michael is calling to introduce Julianne to his seemingly wonderful, irritatingly perfect fiancee Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz) and announce their wedding which is taking place in just three days. That leaves Julianne three short days to break up the marriage and win back the man she has only just realised she loved all along. She will either win or lose - that's the conclusion. Ronald Bass' perfectly-constructed screenplay keeps the viewer on the edge, forever guessing if she will win her battle. Julianne's gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett) agrees to help her, but only to a certain extent, and he is a hilarious asset to the comedic intentions put forth by the writers of the film.  The film's plot seems at times far-fetched, and it is, but this is a light-hearted, romantic comedy with many clich&eacute;s built in for good measure! The comedy is spot-on - there aren't many laugh out loud moments, but more of a continual giggle-fest that will have you smiling for most of the film. Julia Roberts is a certain crowd-puller. People from all over the world will flock to see her movies, and this one was exception. Cameron Diaz was half the superstar in this film that she is today, and her glowing smile and charasmatic confidence shines through in her ditzy role. Rupert Everett reminds me of Hugh Grant in this film, which can be no bad thing!  The film has many memobrable scenes, including Kimberely's hilarious karoke nightclub performance of "I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself. The restaurant hilarity of the group's performance of Dianne Warwick's "I Say A Little Prayer is also perfectly executed, with only professional directors pulling it off - amateurs could have easily messed it up big time. The big city bread truck chase is hilarious, and the film has many touching moments. Julianne's constantly foiled attempts to sabotage the impending wedding are brilliant too
 MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING is a fun romantic comedy that stars Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Rupert Evert and Dermot Mulroney. The story involves Juliette (Julia Roberts), a food critic who realizes she loves her best friend Michael (Dermot Mulroney). Juliette finds out that Michael is getting married and decides to go to stop the wedding from happening, and to try to win him back. From the get go, Juliette is scheming to put a wedge between Michael and his fianc&eacute; Kimmy (Cameron Diaz). Her plans are often foiled and ultimately in the end, in a poignant moment, her friend George (Rupert Everett) asks her if she is chasing Michael and he is chasing Kimmy, who is chasing her?  There are some real fun moments in the movie, like when Juliette pretends she is engaged to her gay friend in order to make Michael jealous. They end up singing "Say A Little Prayer at breakfast. The movie is enriched by a great cast who have chemistry. Julia Roberts convincingly plays Juliette, who should be the enemy, but you end up rooting for her even through her hatched plans. Overall a fun romantic comedy fans of the genre should love.
 Before seeing this movie I wasn't much of a Julia Roberts fan. But now I am! I thought she played an excellent part. As well as the other characters. In the beginning I predicted what I thought was going to happen. I was completely wrong! That's one reason why I liked it so much. I also liked how the suspense kept you in the movie. Like what she was going to next and if she would ever get Michael. I also liked the part at the restaurant where they sing  I'll Say a Little Prayer for you .
 this is the best movie i have ever seen! it makes me cry just thinking about it... i really recomend buying this movie cause its da bomb.. no seriously! if your the kind of person that loves to cry and loves sad  movies.. this is the movie for you! although this movie is suposed to be a  comedy it is also very sad.. even if i watch it twice in a row it still  makes me cry cause i feel so sorry for Julia Roberts... 
 I have to admit that this is one of my favorite movies. It is an absolutely hilarious, romantic comedy. The story was based on an interesting love triangle composed of Julianne (Julia Roberts), Michael (Dermot Mulroney) and Kimberly (Cameron Diaz).  Julianne and Michael have been great friends forever.  They even dated and made a pact to marry (if neither found someone years later).  At the beginning of the movie, Michael calls Julianne to inform and invite her to his wedding.  Immediately, Julianne becomes overwhelmed with jealousy and plans to break up the happy couple.  Michael and Kimberly completely trust Julianne and do not suspect her plan.  In fact, Julianne's meddling seems to make the couple's relationship even stronger.  Kimberly seems to be the perfect fiance in every way. She is willing to do whatever it takes to make her man happy even if she has to sacrifice her own happiness. She also seems to be very naive because she never really knew what her fiance's best friend was up to until the end of the movie. (I guess that is the whole point of the movie.) The dialogue was good and full of laughs.  If you liked Notting Hill or Runaway Bride, you will love this movie. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes romantic comedies or is getting married in the near future.
 julia roberts is not good at all,but diaz is perfect even if her musical skills are not revealed. the story is funny, so buy this movie
 1997 couldnt of happened without this movie!!! funny!! Julia Roberts and Camron Diaz are great in this film!!! Must have!! I cant believe its almost 10 years since it came out. Feels like yesterday when i first saw it.
 I received the item in perfect condition and the shipping was qucik, as well.  Thank you!
 This is one of my favorite movies.I've watched it over and over again 'coz I was captivated by the story and cast. I really loved this flick,it's really hilarious,and cute!  Julia looks great in the movie,and she truly  did a good job.This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh and gets you  thinking  what you really want,and who you are.Go watch it!
 This is my daughter's all-time favorite movie and has been on her wish list since she started it. I was happy to FINALLY get a copy for her. It arrived in excellent condition and very promptly. The seller was great and my daughter has already selected her charmingly handsome gay escort should her "best friend-boy marry.
 IT'S JUST A GREAT MOVIE....SHOWS US THE FOIBLES OF LIFE AND HOW EVERYTHING GOES OUT THE WINDOW WHEN MR. RIGHT COMES ALONG.  JULIA ROBERTS IS PERFECT IN THIS ROLE AND DERMOT MULRONEY CAN HOLD HIS OWN ON SCREEN WITH HER. LOVE CAMERON DIAZ AS THE 'OTHER WOMAN'.  PATS ON THE BACK FOR THE CAST SELECTIONS HERE, NOBODY PLAYS A BAD PART.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I HAVE VIEWED IT MANY TIMES AND I WILL WATCH IT MANY MORE TIMES IN THE FUTURE.
 This is a really good romantic movie. I love Rupert in this movie. And I am so glad that Julia's character failed to break up her best friend's wedding. I also thought Cameron Diaz was good. The ending is simply the best.
 I just find this an absolutely delightful film. It's very well cast and although the storyline goes from the sublime to the ridiculous, it's still manages to keep you entertained.
 I love this movie!! One of my all time favorite movies with a bitter sweet ending so to speak. I love all the actresses/actors that are in it, they did a great job!!
 Julia Robert is a friend to a guy who is about to get married. There's one problem she loves him, she tries to break up the wedding. And in the process she figures out that he's truly in love with her. At the end the wedding was a success, and Julia falls for a different guy at the reception. I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!
 I just love it!  It's a romantic comedy which was enjoyable to watch and would watch it again and again!  I love the humor and some singing done in the movie.
 This is a kind-of real-life romantic comedy.  There is much criticism about the ending, but it's how real life turns out.  Julianne's (Roberts) fight to get her man is not necessarily reflective of true life--which is not a bad thing--but it's hilarious.  I recommend this movie if you want to cry and laugh in the same two hours.
 Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) has everything that is required to be a romantic comedy heroine - wild hair, a huge smile, a gay best friend (Rupert Everett) and a dilemma in her love life. Her best friend/ex-boyfriend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) has just called her out of the blue, leaving a message on her answermachine telling her to call him - urgently.  Julianne remembers that years ago, she and Michael vowed to marry each other if they were both still single at 28. She's going to turn 28, and leaps to a happy conclusion. However, on returning his call, he drops the bombshell - he's getting married to somebody else. This weekend. Well, what's a girl to do? Armed with her afore-mentioned gay best friend, George, Julianne sets off to Chicago to see what she can do about breaking up the couple and securing Michael for herself.  His fianc&eacute;e, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) is 20 years old and Barbie doll perfect. She doesn't even have a tiny flaw that Julianne can use against her. She is extra-super-nice to Julianne, giving her the position of Maid Of Honour within half an hour of meeting her and bringing all the defences down to admit to her that she is jealous of her relationship with Michael.  Julianne is ruthless. She'll do whatever it takes to get Michael back - and she does a lot of it. She tries to embarrass Kimmy at a karaoke bar, but despite a terrible singing voice Kimmy has chutzpah and wins the audience around. In a bid to make Michael jealous, she convinces George to pose as her husband which he does with pizzazz (describing their first meeting, he muses wistfully, "I knew we'd end up like this - like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza"). And finally she writes a nasty email to Michael's boss, supposedly from Kimmy's father. This is the turning point of the movie. Up until now we have seen Julianne as the heroine and Kimmy as the foe who must be obliterated at all costs. And this is perhaps where we realise that maybe this isn't just another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. But now, maybe we don't want Julianne to win any more. Maybe, just maybe, sweet Kimmy should be the one to end up with Michael. It's not so clear-cut now, and the script keeps us guessing until the end. Roberts gives a great performance here, making Julianne sympathetic even when we don't like her very much. She doesn't have much chemistry with Mulroney as Michael, but then nor does Diaz; perhaps this is the point of the movie. However it is Rupert Everett who manages to steal almost every scene he is in. It's very enjoyable, and slightly black - but only if you want to see that side of it. One to watch.
 MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is definitely my favorite wedding film. With an all-star cast including Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, and Rupertt Everett, it makes this film even more worth-watching. Julianne (Roberts) is a food critic who soon realizes she loves her best friend, Michael (Mulroney), the day he decides to marry Kim, a perky blonde from a very wealthy family (Diaz). Determinded to win him back, Julianne will do anything to break up the couple's wedding - and she only has four days, with the help of her... friend, George (Everett). Every scheme to win Michael back is, of course, hilarious. MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is an excellent, feel-good romantic comedy about one who finds true love for the right person at the wrong time. Will Julianne win Michael? You'll have to see this to learn the answer! But it's actually very surprising at the end. This film is very original, too. This film is definitely worth watching!
 This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's very sweet from beginning to end.  Julia Roberts plays Juliana, a former tomboy who finds out her best friend Michael (Dermott Mulroony) is getting married to a  younger woman, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz).  Juliana then realizes she's in love  with Michael and tries to stop the wedding.  It's a fun movie with romance  mixed with comedy.  It reallymakes you cry at the end.  If you like Notting  Hill, you'll love this too!
 This is a great movie. I enjoy watching My Best Friends Wedding every time. I specially love the beginning when the four girls are singing a song and doing a little dance. Sometimes I will rewind that part a few times before watching the movie.
 Julia Roberts does a great job of playing the bad guy and then redeeming herself. Cameron Diaz is great as well. If you're willing to take this for what it is then you will have a lot of fun watching this and be vastly entertained. This movie is 20 years old and it has aged very well. P.S. There are some musical interludes which made me smile.
 I absolutely love this movie. Julia is adorable in it, and her character is really enjoyable (although the whole food critic thing was just a plot device to allow her to slip away to Chicago for a few days). Mulroney is sexy as hell, and the gay best friend is the end all be all to gay best friends. The ending makes me cry every time to this day (along with the boat ride where she almost tells him she loves him), and it makes you just want everyone to find someone to love and be with and to enjoy life with. Buy this, and watch it over and over when you need a pick me up. It is very funny (especially the "Say a Little Prayer scene), and a great time!!!
 This movie is great. I have watched it several times. The acting is great and there is alot of fun to be had.
 I have to agree with the analysis of a recent reviewer who points out the self-centeredness of the lead characters in this Chicago-based tale.  Food critic Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) and sports broadcaster, Michael O'Neil(Dermot Mulroney)had promised while in college that they would marry each other if neither had married before they were 28, which right there makes love seem like a game where they are concerned.  But three weeks before Julianne is to turn 28, Michael announces his engagement to a 20-year-old college student named Kimberly Wallace(the always sunny Cameron Diaz), much to Julianne's dismay, and realizing her own feelings for Michael, tries to sabotage the impending nuptials--a scenario which, with the skillful writing of Ronald Bass and the skillful direction of P.J. Hogan becomes one of humor and pathos, rather than just one of completely outright meanness and manipulation.  Kimberly embraces Julianne, and after knowing her only a few minutes, makes her her Maid of Honor, a role she pretends to play while trying to create friction between the couple, using various methods,and lastly employing her gay friend, George Downes(Rupert Everett)to pose as her fiance, hoping to make Michael jealous.   Much of this film's entertainment value comes from the well-chosen cast. Philip Bosco and Susan Sullivan portray the bride's dignified parents Walter and Isabelle Wallace,Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston are Samantha and Mandy Newhouse, like-dressing characters from the South, who will also serve as bridesmaids, Chris Masterson as the Best Man-to-be is a fairly shy, and awkward youth, although, along with a few peer group members, he gives one of the most amusing scenes in the movie, which involves helium,Paul Giamatti plays Richard, an empathetic bellman, Harry Shearer plays Jonathan P.F. Ritt, and M. Emmett Walsh plays Joe O'Neal.  More delightful moments occur during an outing at a seafood restaraunt, where, while conjuring up a story behind their fake engagement, George leads everyone in singing Dionne Warwick's "I Say a Little Prayer", and when one of the bridesmaids gets her tongue stuck on an ice sculpture.   Things come to a head when Julianne follows George's advice and finally reveals her true feelings as Kimberly stumbles upon the scene, and a viewer can only hope for some just resolution.   For me, this film has called to mind the lyrics of a 1958 song by Don Cornell called "Play Some Music for Broken Hearts", in which the final stanza is
 The item that i ordered got here in record speed! I was really happy to see it came so fast.  The DvD that I had purchased was in amazing condition, no scratches, like new!
 I've been watching films since the 1950's, so my opinion should count for something. James Felix McKenney (Director) has come a long way. In this film you can see he has learned one of the most important lessons in film-making
 Being a big time horror fan and a diehard collector I love this movie alot, the acting and special effects were right on point. You encounter a lake monster in the dead winter was a brilliant idea and concept, the monster effects was hands down freaking awesome and unique. Hypothermia is a downright horror/science fiction monster you must have in your collection of monster films. Having this film in my horror collection is truly a honor, hats off to MPI Media Group, Glass Eye Pix and Dark Sky Films for bringing and distributing this film to horror fans like myself who live and breathe horror films. Hypothermia gets 2 thumps, a perfection 10 and 5 stars...HYPOTHERMIA KICKS MAJOR BUTT IN THE GENRE OF MONSTER/HORROR FILMS
 This excellent multinational production of the Mahabharata feels almost Shakespeaerean at times - the language so eloquent and poetic, the themes so profound and universal, the action so epic.  Truly great literature brought to film. Briefly, the Mahabharata is a tale of two rival sets of brothers, cousins to eachother, each born into royalty and with divinely guided paths in life.  The result, however, is a great war, death, destruction, but a final glimmer of light preserved.  Vishnu after Shiva. . Peter Brook's five-hour version of the Mahabharata is theatrical, philosophical, spare, poetic.  It is rendered in gentle, nearly monochromatic hues and with often silent backgrounds, interspersed with periods of hauntingly beautiful music. The actors are gifted, if a bit too grand and mythic in their presentation.  As in the written versions, the characters motives are seen to be, in turns, grounded and human, and unearthly and enlightened. Such a powerful mix, and such a penetrating vision of life -- all from over three thousand years ago! I highly recommend this film, anbd the special features of the DVD make it that much more valuable.
 I too grew up hearing stories of the Mahabharata and watched this adaptation on the BBC a few years back.  This is theatre at its best, and it truly captures the essence of the Mahabharata.  The stories and concepts are all covered, but those who are expecting an all Indian cast wearing traditional garb will be sorely disappointed.  Hinduism is a way of life, a faith of choice and plurality.  These ideas are reinforced with a multicultural cast.  When I first heard that it was not an all Indian cast, my expectations for the play dropped dramatically, but I can assure you, what Peter Brook has done is astonishing.  I look forward to watching this with my children, though after they have been inundated with bedtime stories from the Mahabharata.
 Years ago I watched this on television and later video.  I was blown away by the depth of the material and the performances of the cast.  This is definitely no hollywood production but it is great theatre.  I emphasize that it is just that - theatre.  I have since read the original Indian texts (translated) and it took me many months, the writing was complicated and it took me ages just to identify with the names (sorry but I have a Western upbringing).  Once I got over this it is fair to say that the intricacies and subtleties of the full story are completely lost from Peter Brooks work. Completely!  This is probably why so many people who are familiar with the text are so unhappy with this version.  Chopra's - very long (but well priced and a great series) - interpretation is far more faithful but lacks, in my opinion, the intensity that is present in Brook's work.  Chopra's version whilst being far more faithful is also clearly aimed at Indian TV audiences (e.g., there are filler scenes that breakup the momentum of the story) also the audio quality on my DVDs and subtitling is poor.  I have since watched Brook's version many times and decided it is not really a story about the Mahabharata at all (it seems very different now) but nevertheless carries a story of its own (perhaps more of Brook's story) but its real strength is its ability to enthrall with very little else but strong characters and a few props.... that is just great theatre in my mind!  But it would be a mistake to take a 5 hour interpretation of the text as faithful - especially since Chopra took 94 episodes to do the same (which still misses some things in the text - I definitely recommend Chopra's version - definitely good value and conceptually much deeper than Brook's version).  But the names are the same and Brooks version gives a taster to the wisdom of the text.  I love Brook's (and strongly recommend it) version as a theatrical work but now believe it should never have been called the Mahabharata.
 My wise cousin told me to watch this film before I come to visit her in India, and how right she was. The story of the  Mahabharata  permeates Hindu culture in much the same way the Bible has formed Western consciousness. But such a story! The basic tale is of a feud between two branches of a family, rulers, sons of gods but all too human. Having no prior knowledge of this great epic I found it a bit confusing at first, a lot of background is related in a brief beginning, the multi-national, multi-racial cast led to a little confusion among characters. But the story line quickly develops as the legitimate heir loses his kingdom to the other branch of the family in a crooked dice game. The tension builds as Yudhishthira gambles inexorably for higher and higher stakes, finally losing his brothers and beloved wife. He is offered one final chance to redeem all or escape, and agrees to throw the dice one more time against his brothers' advice, and loses. His reason-- I had to give the cheaters one more chance to save themselves.  This is the first of many very complicated moral dilemmas presented, but there are no easy answers here. Is it permissible to lie to avoid a greater harm? Is cheating in a fight wrong, even if your opponent is guilty of many wrongs against you? At first it seemed that there were good guys and bad guys in this story, a notion sometimes reinforced in imagery, such as in the chariot fight between Karna and Arjuna, with black and white horses. But we quickly see that life isn't so simple--the good guy strongman Bhima kills his enemy and eats his heart with gory relish. Even the god-man Krishna urges tricks to defeat the enemy. The women in the story were strong, complicated, grounded. Can a woman love five husbands equally? Yes, in this world. Does the mother of five sons grieve for the sixth she abandoned long ago and who became the enemy of his brothers? Yes, and her pain is compelling. I felt I could watch this film many times and still not understand all of it. The vision of the world is so different from a western view--gods and men together in the world, good and evil existing within both. And I'm sure this wasn't a totally faithful rendition of the story. But compared to the impossibility of picking up the text cold and trying to read it, this is a wonderful alternative.
 I was entranced by The Mahabharata, as presented by Peter Brookes. Since my childhood, I have heard, read and seen The Mahabharata in my mother tongue, English and Hindi. Irrespective of the medium, it has always impressed with the great canvas on which human yet larger than life characters are etched but the grandeur of the drama has often masked the underlying philosophy - that the difference between humans and gods is infinitesimal, that every person is imbued with some qualities that are god-like (so that depending on circumstances anybody can appear god-like), even the so-called gods have human frailties and can be touched and befriended. Peter Brookes has successfully denuded the characters of their physical attributes and forced us to really understand this philosophy that we too can become gods depending on which qualities we care to nurture within our selves.
 I was raised on stories from the Mahbharata and my parents showed me this movie when I was about ten years old.  Even though it is low budget and very, very long, I loved it.  I started showing it to my friends, who have no Indian background or knowledge at all and they loved it too.  I'll never forget when we were about thirteen years old we started watching it at a sleepover and were too tired to finish.  In order to see the whole thing before our moms came to take us home we would have to wake up at 6
 It was more than ten years ago that the Dutch television broadcasted 'The Mahabharata' by Peter Brook. First on three wednesday evenings, a couple of months later on one evening with just enough breaks to get to the toilet or get some coffee. This old story about the beginnings of Indian history, culture and religion is a fascinating story, with all the questions concerning life itself in it. We had it on video and watched it at least once every year, but for the last couple of years because the videotapes got worse. Now we have the dvd's (after a long search) and enjoy the whole action, the thoughts, the colors and the depth of the whole play.
 I cannot comment on how faithful this is to the original.  Nor can I comment on whether or not it may or may not be offensive to Hindus.  I don't know.  I hope it isn't, however, because it is certainly a beautiful work of theatre as art.  My family begged me to watch this for years and years, but with raising a family, I just didn't have a spare 5-6 hours.  Recently, however, I finally had time -- and it was so worth it.  The performance was so finely acted and directed.  I think especially of the brother who tells a lie for the first time.  How he touches his lip after the words are spoken, amazed that untruth could come out of his mouth.  I think about the actor who played Krishna -- Wow!  And especially, the actor who plays the old blind king.  That is just so well done.  At any rate, if it is offensive to Hindus, then don't see it.  But if it isn't, then it is truly worth the time.
 Weighing in at 5 hours and 25 minutes, "The Mahabharata is an epic tale based on the religious text of the same name.  While I'm far from ignorant of the Mahabharata, I'm no expert.  All I've read is the Baghavad-Gita.  You certainly don't need to be well-read on Hindu mythology to appreciate this film.  I first saw this film by renting it at a video store specializing in rare and imported videos.  I then purchased it through Amazon.com because this was something I just had to have.  The film is actually a stage play.  But don't let that discourage you into thinking that you will simply be watching actors perform on a stage.  This is one extravagent production!  The costumes are very rich, the sets are large and realistic, and the camera work is angled and edited in such a way that you'll think you're watching a film instead of a straight stage production.  For example, during the war chapter, actual horses are brought onto the stage where dozens of actors fight in a well choreographed manner!    The acting is something that I have never seen before.  I don't get out to see many plays, but what I've seen in this is amazing.  The camera gets in tight on the actors faces and these actors do a superior job of expressing severe intensity.  Especially the two actors who play Krishna and Arjuna; wow!    If you're into Hindu mythology on any level, then I assure you that you will enjoy this film.  Despite its length this film never gets boring.  Mind you, I wouldn't suggest watching this in one sitting.  There are two discs, watch one, and watch the next one the next day.
 Mahabharata, directed by Peter Brook, is a great movie. It is a must see for all who are interested in epic mythology and who would like to understand more about the religious philosophies and culture of India. As an Indian I have heard countless stories about Mahabharata and seen many Indian movies based on Mahabharata. The story is vast and often spawned many discussions on arguments on why things were what they were - the plot, chartecters, etc. I first saw the theatrical version of the Peter Brook version in 1989, and was amazed by the beauty and grandeur of the production and also was quite impressed how effectively the strory was told and enacted by an international cast of stage and screen actors.  Mahabharata is a must collect item and worth watching once every year !!!
 If you are ever roving around in the video store (or library, for that matter), and are looking for a film that is going to make you think, keep you on the edge of your seat, teach you important life lessons, and appeal to your senses, "The Mahabharata is the film for you. However, you are going to need a whole day to fully appreciate this masterfully told story.  (It clocks in at around 8 hours, total.)  I know that sounds daunting, but, believe me, it is well worth it.  One of the most gifted geniuses of the stage, Peter Brooke, has directed/produced an amazing labor of love, with his adaptation of the epic Sanskrit collection of stories, centered on two sets of warring brothers (the Pandavas and the Kauravas), both in hot pursuit of the throne.  It took Peter Brook eight years to fully conceptualize and complete this film, and it shows.  The actors span a dozen countries, come from a cross-section of backgrounds and are also multi-generational.  In his choice of casting, it truly cuts to the heart of, what I believe is the central point of "The Mahabharata.  It is the story of the plight of mankind.  If that isn't a more universal story, I don't know what is. Beautiful, brilliant, and very appealing to a diverse audience.
 Many reviews here deplore the butchered three-hour version with good reason.  Be sure to scroll down to the DVD details to make sure you are getting the six-hour version.  There is a Hindi version of this great epic, which was very popular in India, but it is extremely long, with many digressions that Western audiences will find distracting.  The Peter Brook version has been painstakingly translated and designed and made accessible to a modern Western audience, much the way Laurence Olivier did with his Shakespeare movies.  For those with intelligence and sensibility -- i.e. for adults -- this is one of the most profound stories they will ever see.  For those without -- i.e. for adolescents -- it will be a bore.  The Mahabharata is longer than and as ancient as the Bible.  Some of the parallels between the two are too close to be mere coincidence
 This is the creation of the poem to engrave drama in the hearts of man, which culminates in the 18-day war between the noble Pandava princes and their scheming cousins, the Kaurava kings that decides the fate of mankind.  We see how free will and fait can co-exist. Notice that Krishna has an agenda that may or may not be that of the other players in the game. Even in the 18-day war every rule is broken every value is destroyed, leaving no difference between whom is good or who is evil, who is an enemy or who is not. As Krishna does throughout the movie, we see that the only way the Pandava can win is to use any means.  Peter Brook encapsulated the essence of the Mahabharata in a 9-hour play.

There are other film and book versions of the story some better some not as good however this is a brilliant work and should not be missed.

 In India, folks will happily watch (if they can) 60 or more episodes of a traditional saga -- done in a single studio, with actors sitting on cardboard props against a blue screen -- and love every minute of it, because they already know the tales by heart and are entering into the celebration of them.  So how does one condense the longest epic poem in the world into a format that will be watched by Westerners with (comparatively) short attention spans?  Yes, this DVD does presume some knowledge of the original; so if you don't know the story, get a Cliff's Notes or look it up on Wikipedia; your viewing will be a lot more pleasurable if you're not trying to figure out the plot as you go.  The delivery is in practically Shakespearean English, to give it the elevated sense the subject requires, and this may take some getting used to as well -- especially since the international cast, representing (visually) ALL of humanity -- can sometimes stumble on the delivery (I agree; subtitles would be a good idea).  Overall, Brook and company have done an excellent job of capturing the essence of the epic Mahabharata, and bringing its central themes to a western audience -- albeit not via spoon feeding; the audience has to recognize the themes, as they're not presented overtly.  I've watched the DVD more than a dozen times, and never cease to be impressed with the depth and subtlety of the writing and direction.  In my book, it beats Bollywood any day, and makes a foreign masterpiece very accessible to us.

 Make no mistake; this is an abridged version of the original 1990 interpretation and in spite of this, I give it five stars. Peter Brook was the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company in London and of the International Centre for Theatre Research in Paris at the Bouffes du Nord. He has worked on many projects with Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re (President of the French School for Film and Television), who wrote a mini-script of The Mahabharata (Methuen Drama, 1988) that Brooks translated into English. The play came to New York in a nine-hour full stage version (Brooklyn Academy of Music, 1987); it was followed by a six-hour film version which was telecast in Europe in 1989 and by PBS in 1991and has become a DVD collectors' item; I hope that IMAGE will come again with the 285-minute version. Now there is this three-hour version, which was projected in the movie theatres in the mid-nineties. Fortunately, this version conserves intact the original section on the Bhagavad-Gita, and includes the original documentary on "the making of The Mahabharata (54 min.) as a bonus, which deserves to be seen. The cast is composed of a selected group of 42 international actors (India, USA, Burkina-Faso, Japan, Vietnam, Italy, England, Senegal, ....etc.). The music was composed by Toshi Tsuchitori; the songs were interpreted by Sarmila Roy (there is a beautiful CD with the film music
 I first heard of the Mahabharata when I was reading reviews for the video of the play, Nicholas Nickleby. I was rather interested in it. I finally bought the DVD last year because I felt like I had to have it for some reason.  It was worth every penny.  Everything about this movie is perfect. The sets are gorgeous. I love all of the natural elements like water and rock and fire everywhere. And the sand is pretty cool too. Out of all of the performances, two of them are my absolute favorites, Mallika Sarabhai as Draupadi and Mamadou Dioume as Bhima. Had this play opened on Broadway, these two actors would have won Tonies for their parts. Peter Brook and Jean-Claude Carriere created an amazing piece for the stage and for film. There were some moments of the film where I just sat in silence spellbound. One example is when Krishna (wonderfully played by Bruce Meyers) stands above Arjuna (another great performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno) revealing his true form. The symbolic gestures are stunning and the special effects are enchanting without losing theatricality. Most of all is the overall message of the poem itself. The poem dares to explore all aspects of human life, something that epics like The Iliad or The Odyssey just don't do. Peter Brook is a theatrical genius.  Especially informative is the behind the scenes featurette. It's fun to watch people hearing their views on doing the play and working with Peter. Mallika Sarabhai is even more likeable offscreen than on as we see when she's speaking in the documentary and offering insight on how The Mahabharata is not just religion but pop culture in India. I believe Yoshi Oida (the amazing actor who plays Drona) puts it perfectly about what The Mahabharata has to offer, "In (the) film, we are playing greater (people), greater than us. So, I feel that if I imitate (these people) every day, maybe I (will) become (a) greater person. Yoshi, I intend to do the same thing.
 Watch the making of, and you'll see director/co-writer Peter Brook speak about his contempt for actors who seek personal fame, when they should put their career-making egos aside and focus instead on the work itself... yet Brook's name appears in giant letters on the box, and in the USA the DVD is even listed not as 'The Mahabharata,' but 'Peter Brook's The Mahabharata.' What a tool!  Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re and Marie-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Estienne apparently spent 8 years co-writing the screenplay with Brook, yet their names do not appear on the DVD front cover at all.  The making-of documentary includes footage with actress Mallika Sarabhai saying of Brook
 There are two version of this stage production being offered here.  And although they are from the same production, the one that's titled "Peter Brook's The Mahabharata is a 2 DVD set, over 315 minutes while the other one dated as "2008", is only 1 disk and 170 minutes.  The criticisms of the shorter version may be valid. Amazon appears to be applying the reviews of the shorter one to both. The longer version is much more complete and easier to follow, AND is very enjoyable.  It is easily FIVE STAR quality. But the reality is that if the Mahabharata is presented quicker than maybe 2 months of straight delivery, it's abridged.
 Really impressed with this movie.  It was worth the money.  By watching the behind the feature, it really helped to understand the movie from beginning to end.  Looking forward to watching the movie a second time.
 THE DVD I GOT IS NOT VERY GOOD, IT DOES NOT HAVE SUBTITLES AND THE IMAGE IS BLURRY, BUT IS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I TRIED TO GET THIS PRODUCT, SO I SHOULD BE GLAD YOU GOT IT FOR ME. THANK YOU, BEATRIZ BELTRAN.
 This is the best adaptation of the Mahabharata ever that i have seen. It is definitely something to own.
 Pours wisdom right into the soul. It changed my life. The largest poem on Earth and it is about YOU! This 6 hour film is derived from the 9 hour stageplay. Absolutely unique and tells you about the meaning of life.
 My 3-year-old daughter, as well as my 16-year-old daughter, loved this movie. I found the content agreeable.  So what if a girl has a crush on a boy, or had been asked if there was a kiss? It's a natural and human progression, afterall, don't parents greet each other with a kiss or affection in the presence of their kids? Barbie Diaries captured the youngest's attention with very good music, and most importantly, the story is a good lesson on being true to yourself, being studious, (Barbie is an honor student in this movie) loyal to your friends and following your dreams. Even the advice of keeping a diary is a good one, we get to see how far we have come, how our goals are realized, etc.. No dark and evil characters like in Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus, Rapunzel, Mermaidia, Fairytopia, etc.., just the nuisance of a self-centered, shallow, popular girl who tries to make Barbie miserable, but all is settled in the end for the benefit of all. It's all good.
 Hi 
 Call me nuts and a dork or even call me childish.. Being 21 and still into barbies is fun.. Only difference is i dont play with barbie dolls i just collect them.. When i heard about this movie and seeing the previews i know i had to add it to my collection.. Its a great movie and it really has a great message that we all need to remember.. Just because we would like to fit in doesnt always mean its a great idea.. It can have its ups and down.. The music for the movie is awesome.. The graphics are out of this world amazing.. Although it couldve had a better storyline and some of the outtakes shouldve been used because they were awesome.. Only thing dumb out the DVD is a special feature called 'Kevins Paper Clip Movie Featurette'.. So i dont give to much away all i can say dont take my word for it see this movie for yourself.. ta ta for now..
 This movie seems so interesting cuase we will see how Barbie lives in the realworld with the new friends Tia, Courtney, Kevin & Todd. & for the first time an Mean character will be introduce in Barbie's world her name is Raquelle and she the Queen of mean aand she hates Barbies I already saw the doll on Ebay I can't wait to get her
 It's a little mature for the typical Barbie crowd.  I bought it for my four year old daughter, and I was taken aback a bit by the more mature themes represented on the DVD (high school, Fall Formals, crushing on the cutest guy in school, etc).  But I actually like the DVD myself.  It's sweet, and has great music throughout by Skye Sweetnam.  My daughter watches it with me, and we discuss things she doesn't understand.  She also loves the music.  But, once again, it would have been nice to have a bit more of a head's up on the actual content.
 I LOVE THIS MOVE!!! They have to come out with a second one. This movie is awesome. I'm a teen and i love it! i loved the other barbie movies but for once it is about real life. And the songs rock. i hope they come out with a soundtrack. This movie should definately be bought. It is fun with todays humor (only the good ones) and is great even for teenagers. take my word for it. It is amazing.
 I completely LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd movie ! ! ! ! The girls in the movie are between the ages of 15 and 16. They're in their sophmore or second year of high school so it's nice for tweens and teens. I love this movie and it has a nice lesson at the end. It plays perfectly and it arrived two days early. This is my second favorite Barbie movie  next to Barbie Mariposa ). I've only had it for a week and I've watched it over 20 times 
 I am the mother of a Barbie-obsessed 4-year-old and bought this unaware of the plot.  I like the movie but think it's too mature for my daughter right now.  It would be great for a girl in middle school however.  I did find it entertaining.
 This is a Barbie dvd that teaches some real life lessons and inspired my daughter to start a journal.  What more could a mom want in a dvd?  Oh yeah, good music.  It had that too.
 Personally thought this was a great film, most young girls or teens can relate to The graphics are probably the best yet out of the rest of the barbie movies I also did not think that the movie was too mature for young audiences as a previous reviewer stated The scene when Kevin commented on the girls hugging wasn't in any way, shape or form meant to be crude Anyone should be able to see, that Kevin only tries to find ways to be get barbie to realize how much he loves her. It saddens me, to see that someone could have such a negative outlook over such innocent emotions I suppose it's because of reviews like that, why television cencors everything now days
 Honestly, I like ALL the Barbie movies. They are a little cheezy and have fun story lines that anyone can enjoy.  But this one is differnt. First of all, it has a GREAT soundtrack! I absolutely love the music. I'm 26 years old and would have the songs on my playlist and no one would ever know it was from a Barbie movie if they hadn't seen it.  This movie is geared toward older kids, but my younger kids love it as well. I also like the movie. Having to on occasion watch a movie 20 times in a row, having a movie you can enjoy can really help ease the pain of repetitive movies.  The story line is a lot better than some of the fantasy based ones. The dialog is fun and more mature.  All in all, great movie!
 Wow, I'm kinda glad Barbie did this. A teen like movie, I can't wait to watch it. but I wonder why it's showing on TV before it comes out. Oh well, I'm thinking of watching it caue it looks really good. Bratz, Danny Phantom, and My Scene ROCK!!!
 The DVD was received in great condition and in a timely manner.  I will order from seller again.
 This is old Fat Chance Bellydance beginners class in a new cover. If you like FCB, tribal fusion, or fun way to burn calories this is the Thing! Good for all levels, easy to follow for newbies , fun way to drill basics for more advanced students.
 The acting and story are superb. Blending a great western and history lesson in the what occurred in the late 1800's. If you are a Robert Duvall fan you will love it!
 Duvall at his best! Thomas Haden Church absolutely fantastic! The best western in years! Simply put...cinema doesn't get any better than this!
 Thank you Mr. Hill, and especially you, Mr. Duvall, for this wonderful piece of work. Whenever nature gets either one of you up at night, you can can go back to sleep knowing you did good, real good. Thank you.
 ROBERT DUVALL IS GOOD IN ALL THE MOVIES HE HAS MADE. THIS IS ONE OF HIS GREATEST WITH ACTION, LOVE INTEREST AND SUPPORT FROM HIS CO-ACTORS. THIS IS RIGHT UP WITH ASSINATION TANGO. THANKS MR DUVALL
 1.  I watched half of this via cable while on the road and was so intrigued by it that I got the DVD later on.  2.  Others have mentioned the pros / cons of this movie;  I just think it's one of the best Westerns out there--> great acting, a definite unique twist to the usual Western storyline, and it's based (I don't know how loosely) on a true story.  3.  A definite 5 star.
 An awesome movie.  I had seen it twice and decided I had to own it!
 We had previously seen this movie.  It was so good we wanted to add it to our library.  We enjoyed seeing it again.  We plan to watch it again and share it with our friends.  Thank you for your prompt service.
 This is really a great film to see! Good westerns are getting harder to come by these days. Maybe Hollywood will wise up and make more films of this caliber. Not a moment too soon!
 I thought good westerns died with John Wayne, but this movie will rank high with the classic westerns of yesteryear. Robert Duvall has true grit.
 I am a fan of westerns, but more a fan of great moviemaking and storytelling. Every once in a while comes a great western that leaves you thinking  man this is how a western should be done". With a great cast, story, and superb direction. Again actor Robert Duvall is at the helm of the movie "Broken Trail and again he brings the story to life just as he did for "Lonesome Dove and "Open Range". Without giving away any of the details, this movie has it all. The struggles, tragedies, and the love of humanity of the men and women of that bygone era called the "Untamed West". See it, enjoy it, but most of all, appreciate what great moviemaking is all about.
 This is a great western [mini-series] that should be on everyone's list of Top 25 westerns of all time. It entertains as a western and has an important social message as well. Robert Duvall is amazing as usual and Thomas Haden Church and the supporting cast are excellent as well. If you haven't seen this yet you're in for a wonderful treat and if you've seen it before as I have, at least three times, you'll remind yourself how perfect this western is; and it's beautiful in High Definition!
 I enjoy a great Weatern especially one starring Robert Duvall. I now have, what he calls his trilogy viz. Lonesome Dove, Open Range, and now Broken Trail. Robert Duvall and Clint Eastwood Weaterns are thoroughly enjoyable. I should like to mention I find Amazon provide an excellent service including s perfect follow-up to the purchase. Thank You.  Mike Davies
 A very good western, with somewhat of a chick flick imbedded, meaning my wife enjoyed it too.
 As an old lover of "oaters who thought the genre was mired in the narcissism of the Zane Grey/Owen Wister perceptions until that high watermark and irreducible teleseries, "Lonesome Dove, I was pleasantly surprised AND impressed by this two-parter, equally "true and moving if not quite as embracive and detailed as the former. This Walter Hill effort boasts as flawless a production, from writing through casting and the visuals, plus right-on performancw all around, as to set its own standards. And, as a Chinese-American, its singular and "authentic period Chinese plotline peg struck me as precedential AND arresting. Now, if only someone could make the "back story to the five Chinese girls who literally "make this movie what it is, playing off the standard western white hat/black hat themes. Beautifully, I must add. In my book, one for the books.
 Robert Duvall in another western in the league of Lonesome Dove? You bet, and with Thomas Hayden Church playing an equally as good part.I've watched this movie three times and I'll probably watch it another time before I put it in the rack.
 This movie looks so good on Blu-ray Disc. The Story is Good!!!    So own Broken Trail today.
 I absolutely loved this movie.  I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this movie was different.  It actually had depth to it and wasn't just some gunslinging western.  I liked the little romance part and the way things ended between Tom and Sun Foy.
 I really enjoyed the entire DVD but being an old time traditionalist, I was not happy with the ending which was just plain depressing.  Robert Duvall has now set the standard for resurrecting the old time westerns and proves that there is a demand for good quality movies not depending on sex or excessive violence in order to garner viewers.........  Mr. Duvall has now become one of my favorite actors and joins my other favorite Tom Selleck................
 I love westerns and am glad to see they are making more of them with great success.
 This is a movie well worth watching over and over it is a clean exciting movie that leaves you wanting more of the same. <a href="http
 Well... to start, I rented this video because of the accolades that I had heard at the Golden Globes. I then sat through all four hours in one sitting and watched it another four times within a week! This reminds me of Thousand Pieces of Gold with the wonderful Chris Cooper and Rosalind Chao telling the true story of China Polly. Finally, another western that incorporates the Chinese American experience. The language, acting, scenery are all magnificent.  Robert Duvall gets yet another glowing review from me. Probably the most natural actor... especially in the western genre. And Thomas Hayden Church brilliantly acted. His restraint and angst felt so real. I was so pleasantly surprised and impressed by his take on Tom Harte.  I'm so happy that this is available for purchase.
 This movie was recommended to me by a friend as one I would like being a big Western fan (especially of more modern Westerns!) I bought this Blu-Ray with nothing else to go on and it was pretty good. I didn't realize that it is a two disc/two-part movie and it is quite long, but despite that it is a good and entertaining story
 When I saw the duration of this film - FOUR HOURS! - I immediately reached for the delete button. How could anyone as important as me spend four hours on a single movie?! But my thumb was curious, and slipped from "delete to "play", completely disobeying my wishes. That was the beginning of a terrific slide down the slippery slope of self-indulgence.  Robert Duval brings verisimilitude to the role of the crusty old trail boss, and the supporting cast is truly supporting. No character wavers a jot from their role, and the end result is a gritty and believable portrayal of the west at the turn of the century. The scenery is real - and beautiful beyond description.  Along with the likes of the wonderful Michael Caine movie, "Harry Brown", this film takes its place among my all time favorites.
 A must see for anyone who enjoys Robert DuVall.  Great cast....and oh what a lovely story.  Well worth seeing even if you're not a "cowboy so to speak.  So get out the popcorn and watch a spectacular movie, the story line just keeps you right in the movie.
 Love Robert Duvall and in this movie he is at his best.  He looks to be a real horseman as I have known quite a few in my day.  Very authentic.  Well made movie with beautiful scenery.  As a matter of fact, I think we'll watch it again tonight.
 It is not every actor who can portray an Irish mob lawyer, a radio evangelist and a seasoned cowboy (my favorite) all with the same verve and mastery.  And you've got to love a man who knows how to ride a horse. Duvall rides his horse like he's driving a Cadillac - with total comfort, style and ease.  Very sexy.
 This is a great movie, of course my husband & myself enjoy Robert Duvall. This movie shows the decent side of some cowboys, & the ruthless side of a few. You don't know what will happen next as they drive the 500 horses and encounter Chinese girls. I think the show was very well done.
 Great Classic Western with a twist!  A father and his step son work to take a group of horses across country to sell them to the Army, then are sidetracked as they try to save a group of Chinese girls from being delivered to a Brothel in the West.  They treat them as sisters and daughters and the relationship is both sweet and tragic as they end up forced to fight the "owner as she sends men to try to retrieve them.  Highly recommend this if you like westerns with good stories.
 Broken Trail was recommended to me by a friend as a modern Western that I would enjoy. I missed it on TV, but had a chance to get it via Netflix recently. Watched it with my wife and truly enjoyed the movie. Good story, excellent scenery, interesting characters, and a gun fight, or two.  Robert Duvall continues proving that he is a great Western actor who can handle mature and complex characters. He is not the Duke or Clint, but has a style all his own. Thomas Haden Church provides a surprisingly strong performance as the reluctant nephew. He has come a long way from his "Wings days. Many other reviews detail the plot, so no reason for me to rehash it.  I think the two things I enjoyed most about the film are the scenery (stunning) and the realistic depiction of the West. I always imaginged the West to be a dirty, harsh, tough and dangerous setting. The movie does an excellent job of depicting this era. If you like other Westerns like Open Range, or Lonesome Dove, then you will enjoy this one as well. I highly recommend it.
 ...and you're likely to have a masterpiece on your hands. That was true of "Tender Mercies, "Lonesome Dove, and "Open Range, and it's also true of "Broken Trail, Walter Hill's mesmerizing, exquisitely photographed Western miniseries about a couple of cowboys--uncle and nephew--who come to the rescue of five Chinese girls who were sold into prostitution. Duvall's Print Ritter can't help but remind you of "Lonesome Dove's Gus McCrae or "Open Range's Boss Spearman, but at the same time Print is very different from Gus or Boss in subtle ways that only a master actor such as Duvall can make clear. "Broken Trail is magnificently acted throughout. Thomas Haden Church forgoes his usual goofy persona as Print's nephew Tom Harte, in a thoroughly convincing portrayal of a brave, sad cowboy, downtrodden by life yet beholden to no one. Chris Mulkey--bearing more than a passing resemblance to the late Howard Duff--is properly loathsome as the outlaw "Big Ear Ed Bywaters, and Greta Scacchi is deeply moving as Nola, a hard-luck woman menaced by Bywaters and enamored of Print. Viewers might complain that the young Chinese women don't becomne very individualized, but--given the movie's realism in showing that the girls can't speak English or comprehend Wild West culture--that was probably inevitable. Alan Geoffrion--who also wrote the original novel of "Open Range"--provides a screenplay that isn't all happily-ever-after, but is satisfyingly poignant and filled with rich dialogue and characterizations. "Broken Trail is a must-see for Robert Duvall fans and Western fans alike.
 I fell in love with this movie. The cinematography is beautiful and the setting is idyllic.  Robert Duval proved once again what depth he has as an actor.  He is a true story teller with his craft.  I hadn't seen the supporting actor, Thomas Hayden Church in anything other than "Sideways and was skeptical about him pulling off the role of Robert Duval's nephew.  He surprised me with his believable character.  The story is truly remarkable when you consider that it is based on real lives.  (Is that a spoiler?)  I highly recommend this movie!
 This is one of the best Westerns to come out in several years. It reminds me of of some of the older Westerns, great story and great acting. You can't beat Robert Duvall, he just makes you believe he's an old Cowboy. Thomas Haden Church missed his calling, he could have made some good Westerns over the years. The only problem is nobody writes enough good ones these days. Hopefully THC will get that chance to make a few more in his career.
 best tv movie i have seen in a long long time. it was great.
 This in one of the best westerns of the modern era. I was a stuntman in Hollywood during the 50's when the western was it's most popular. I worked on some huge projects but none as good as todays western. Broken Trail in as good as.....or better, then OPEN RANGE, THE UNFORGIVEN or SILVERADO. Duvall is the "real western cowboy. I worked with him on THE PURSUIT OF D. B. COOPER in 1980 and it doesn't appear that he has changed hardly at all. I recommend this film and guarantee you will watch it over and over.
 This is a fantastic western that certainly urges me to read the novel. The attention to details regarding the time period adds to the flavor of this action/drama. The story-line has plenty of trail grit as well as a realistic portrayal of early prostitution and the true fate of most saloon girls. If you're a western lover, this is a must see.  Chrissy K. McVay - Author
 This is an excellent western that has beautiful scenery, a great story line and excellent acting.  Robert Duvall as Print Ritter plays an old cowhand who decides to take horses from Oregon to Sheridan, Wyoming in 1898 to sell them to an Englishman who needs them for the British army.  He takes along his nephew played by Thomas Haden Church.  Early on they come across a slave trader with young Chinese women and girls being taken to a mining camp.  They run into a bad man who is real life (not some comic book character like some of the old westerns) and the story gets more interesting as it proceeds to a natural western like climax.  Along the way, the scenery, the acting, and the story line kept me interested, so interested that I enjoy seeing this western again and again.  And, unlike many modern westerns that seem to revel in violence (ever since the Wild Bunch of the late 1960s) this one is not overly violent, and it doesn't have to be.  It is very enjoyable and higly recommended just the way that it is.
 Great Movie, showing how ordinary people can show and practice human kindness and compassion to those less fortunate. A must see for movie buffs.
 After viewing the excellent saga of "Lonesome Dove & "Streets of Laredo I looked forward with anticipation to this Movie of the old west. Especially when it stars Robert Duvall, a most underrated actor. Well I wasn't disappointed, it's a great movie, which puts John Waynes West in a totally different catagary. Another underrated actor in my opinion is James Garner who played Tommy lee Jones part I believe in Streets of Laredo. I must admit though I was not impressed with "Return to Lonesome Dove". also I liked "Open Range All these movie give to me a more accurate idea of what the west was really like
 This is one of my very favorite movies!  The DVD was packaged very well, and delivery was lightning fast.  Many thanks!  Would highly recommend to others!
 This was an excellent movie, yet I had never even heard of it before I accidently found it in a bargain bin.
 Church and Duvall team up for an excellent movie in the tradition of Lonesome Dove.  A movie should be like a good book only in video and this one definitely fits that criteria.  A recommended see.  Doug Gollihar/Author & Writer
 this series is great. duvall,church and gwendolyn yeo are magnificent. the story was moving and made me weep at certain times.all the asian girls  were so pretty and sweet.it is a shame asian women were sex slaves in this country and others. we learn from this film and hopefully the love between the cowboys and the asian girls will spread worldwide. this film is highly recommemded.
 If you were an equestrian or just loved horses and real honest people, you will Love this movie. Well worth the money.
 this is a great movie and what a amzing story line about the human sprit .I can watch this movie all the time ...5 stars in my book
 We bought this as a gift for my father-in-law.  He is a fan of westerns and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
 Just loved this miniseries. Robert Duvall is absolutely perfect, as is Thomas Hayden Church. Great story, perfectly executed.
 The camera work and scenery here is awesome. Even if the story line were not great this would still be a movie worth watching for the natural beauty of the horses and countryside. However, the story is a great story I enjoy watching this movie every time. Great acting.
 This is one of Robert Duvall's best performances.  If you are a fan, this is a must have.  You'll want to have this in your collection.
 This was a good movie, all 3 hours of it.  I would highly recommend it to any western fan.
 There aren't many actors today who can lay claim to the title "dedicated actor", but Robert Duvall can, anytime. His acting always delivers in one way or another. He is definitely at home in all of his western roles. From Open Range to Broken Trail, Duvall delivers.
 Very good -- never saw it when it first came out -- don't know how I missed it.
 Robert Duvall stars in another great western.  This is a great movie.  It would of been nice if it was all on one DVD, it is broken up into 2 halves.
 I CONSIDERED THIS A VERY INTERTAINING MOVIE.  IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD MY ENTREST VERY WELL EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A LONGER THAN AVERAGE MOVIE. THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS WERE VERY GOOD AND EXTREAMELY BELEAVABLE.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE LIKE IT.
 Beginning with his role as Augustes McCrae in Lonesome Dove(1989), Robert Duvall has carved out his place in western cinimatic history as the Ultimate American Cowboy.  This is not to be confused with the great personae that a certain Mr. Eastwood, among others, has created during his remarkable film career.  We're not talking about the "man with no name that is today's hero, but rather the real cowboy that would also have been revered in his own time.  In Broken Trail, Robert Duvall continues his portrayal of the sage old cowboy who is frought with human frailties, yet hard-edged enough to survive the dangers of his period.  Just watch for Duvall's mouth movements such as spitting, chewing or the  one-handed smoothing his mustache with a bit of saliva. He is THE GREAT AMERICAN COWBOY and this wonderfully crafted western should be watched just for Robert Duvall's presence.
 I would compare this movie to BBC Planet Earth. Both films are great, have a lot of amazing shots and a few not so amazing. My machine plays this movie at about half of computing power, electricity is filtered, HDTV (used as monitor)calibrated with Spider2Express. This Blu-ray release is not as good as 3
 This movie is incredible!  It has a different twist to it that only makes it more appealing.  Duvall and Church are excellent together and I really enjoyed Church's character.  Great acting by all.
 What a pleasure to watch, at last, a western of the kind which made us dream of America. Every image of that movie could be a Norman Rockwell picture or one of the XIX - XX century great american paintings.  I don't know if the American Dream is still alive, but such a movie certainly keeps the Dream of America as such.
 Another great performance from Robert Duvall, who seems to have a knack for performing fine western characters.  Thomas Haden Church gives a equally fine performance with the added bonus of really looking like a weathered old time cowboy. All of the actors give fine authentic performances, esp the bad guys. The result is a good story well told. I just had to add it to my DVD collection.
 Robert Duvall - his usual superb self in the role of a western character.  High praise also for Thomas Haden Church.....splendid performance.
 Item arrived on time and in great shape. Who does not like a good wrestern? Robert Duvall is always great to watch!!!!!!!!!

 My ex-wife turned-me-on to Westerns, which were not high on my hit list before giving-in to her, (Yes, I was a easy mark for a sweet voice and and a pretty face, unfortunately it wasn't hers and she ditched me when I remembered who's it was that raced my heart! Tami, if you ever read this I am sorry for any embarassment it brings you, you know it's All true, so don't damn me, please?)  Anyway, once I made the conversion from Comedy to Western, I found Robert Duvall to be the epiome of a Western Hero. (Perhaps who Willie Nelson was thinking of when he wrote M Heros Have Always Been Cowboys)  This is one of Duvall's finest, watch it, enjoy it and never forge Tami, I won't!
 I have not viewed this film, but have read other reviews.  I realize Robert Duvall had larger roles in his named western trilogy.  But he makes an excellent imprint on the Walter Hill movie of Geronimo which starred Wes Studi as Geronimo, Matt Damon as a young officer.  It was a great movie and is still available.  I will be getting Broken Trail soon.
 "Broken Trail", a dream project for producer/star Robert Duvall, and AMC's first original film, is the spiritual heir to Kevin Costner's 2003 "Open Range (also starring Duvall), and one of the most moving, involving Westerns of recent years.  With a charismatic, extremely effective performance by Thomas Haden Church, as Duvall's long-estranged nephew, the film is one of only a handful of Westerns that combine epic sweep, superb characterization, and an understanding of the 'Real West', without shortchanging decency, or respect of an individual's worth. The era was hard, justice could be swift and brutal, and Duvall, as aging but upright Prentice Ritter, lives by his own rules; to protect the helpless in his care, to respect others, and to be unafraid to resort to violence, if necessary. Tom Harte (Church), despite some family history problems with his uncle, lives by the same code, and the two men, driving a herd of horses from Oregon to Wyoming to raise cash for a ranch, become the 'saviors' of five young Chinese women, sold into prostitution, who inadvertently fall into their hands.  These are good men, in a jaded world, and their journey picks up other 'strays', as well as the women; young Virginian fiddler Heck Gilpin (an engaging Scott Cooper), is rescued by Tom in a saloon; aging Chinese laborer Lung Hay (Donald Fong), and careworn prostitute Nola John (the wonderful Greta Scacchi) join the group after Tom saves the Chinese women from rapists, in a boarding house/bordello. While neither Ritter and Harte were overjoyed at the strange direction the drive was taking, they would not allow harm to fall on 'innocents', and the group bonds into a warm 'family', with Nola and Ritter finding a mature attraction between each other, and Tom and Sun Foy/#3 (Gwendoline Yeo, who speaks only Mandarin, in the film), gently falling in love.  Danger is never far behind them, however, as brutal ex-con 'Big Ears' (Chris Mulkey), with a score to settle with Nola, and a 'contract' to return the Chinese women to whorehouse owner Kate 'Big Rump' Becker (Rusty Schwimmer), trails them, leading a gang of killers...  While the film is long (240 minutes), director Walter Hill, an old hand at Westerns (his "The Long Riders is one of my favorites), keeps the story constantly engrossing, and Duvall and Church have a warmth and authenticity as the characters that will stay with you, long after the movie ends.  Shot in the Canadian Rockies, "Broken Trail combines grandeur and intimacy seamlessly, has moments of great humor to lighten the drama, explosive action, and a bittersweet sense of nostalgia...  It is, simply, superb!
 I watched this film on AMC. This is AMC cable network's first original production starring Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church. It is a fictional story that everyone will want to watch. The background for this movie is based on historical fact of the time. I knew I was going to watch this western as soon as I read that Robert Duvall was involved in the project.  This movie takes place during the late 1800s. It starts with two horse wranglers played by Duvall and Church. Duvall's character, Print Ritter, is Church's uncle. They decide too wrangle horses and sell them to the British Empire who needed them for the Boer War. In the movie we follow this magnificent heard of horses as they are driven east across beautiful country. During the drive they run into five Chinese women who were being kidnapped from the West Coast and brought to the interior west to serve as prostitutes. The story of our horse drive and the story of five Chinese women become intertwined.  What makes this western special is we see the personal growth of Print Ritter from lonesome cowboy to father figure. And what makes this western unique is we see the story from the view of the female characters. Though the movie did not end exactly as I expected, it was close, yet seemed more real.  This is a must see movie. The story line, acting, scenery, background are all top notch. It was hard for me to believe that this was not very large big screen production.
 Wow!  This is why filmmakers make movies.  This movie will capture your imagination and heart.  It is a big epic of a western, beautifuly filmed, with an intriging story line that will keep you guessing right up until the very end.  I am a devoted western movie fan, and this movie ranks up there with the very best of the genre.  Robert Duvall, best known as "Agustus in Lonesome Dove, dons western garb once again and stars in a lengthy, yet thoroughly enjoyable tale of a horse drive across the plains to Sheridan, Wyoming.  Duvall employs his nephew in the endevor, and they unexpectedly meet up with a variety of both endearing and unsavory characters along the way.  This is not a shoot 'em up western. It is not action-packed.  It meanders at a leisurly pace, as an actual horse drive would, yet an enjoyable pace from beginning to end.  Duvall, as the patriarch Print Ritter, and his nephew Tom Harte, (played exceedingly strongly by Thomas Church) take about 500 head of horses to Wyoming.  On the trail, they cross trails with an evil pimp who is moving five Chinese girls to a mining camp where they will be sold into the living hell of prostitution.  The Chinese are sweet innocent beings who are being mistreated by the pimp, and through a series of incidents, the girls become the responsibility of Ritter and Harte.  From there, the group picks up additional characters
