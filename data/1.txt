 Mexican men are macho rapists, gangsters or ineffective bureaucrats. Mexican women are semi-pagan, pious fools. There are self-serving corporate types and even a pushy, culturally-insensitive liberal female reporter.  The story is absurd, the characters are unbelievable, the stereotypes are offensive.
 This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting wasn't good, it was very predictable, and some parts of the plot were competly unnecessary. The worst bit of acting was when Yellow comes home, his owner has no expression when he sees him and does not look even remotely happy. If you want predictable, watch a survival movie. What happens, almost always, is a person gets lost in the wilderness in an accident, they struggle to survive, they are found, and then brought home. "Far From Home" is no exception. As for unnecessary, the whole "romance" part of this movie was badly done and not needed. The girl gives him cookies and kisses him when he comes home, and all the while, the boy of her affections remains pretty much obtuse. Also some parts of this movie might upset young children, such as the time he kills a rabbit and when Yellow can't be rescued. All in all, I would not advise anyone to see this movie; in fact, I would warn against it.
 Classics remain beloved for hundreds of years because they are wonderfully crafted and contain universal truths that still speak to us. The director and producer of this condescending adaptation of Dumas' classic story must feel that the modern American audience doesn't have the intelligence to appreciate great classic works.  Oh, the basic story line is there--man is wronged, man goes to prison, man escapes, man finds treasure, man seeks revenge. But that is where the homage to this great work ends and the often ridiculous changes are made. I know that it is cliche to say that the movie is not as good as the book. In this case, however, I can't believe they actually had the audacity to call the movie by the same name as the classic novel which it so minimally follows.  One can excuse some adaptations of a novel when produced as a screenplay, but the changes made in this case lose all the beauty and terrible power of the original story. Instead of a wonderful slow burn with a lot of atmosphere as Dantes slowly and painstakingly weaves a web of revenge for the wrongs done to him, we have stupid devices like a flamboyant entry in a hot air balloon, complete with Cirque du Soleil acrobats twisting on the ropes. Instead of an intricate plan to destroy the personages who wronged him, we have swashbuckling sword fights every few scenes.  Some major characters are missing completely (such as Valentine) some have been shamelessly changed and substituted (Jacopo for Ali). The final plot device is totally contrived and NOT in the book--we find out that Dantes has a son sired on Mercedes before he was arrested. I guess the screenwriters felt they had to put some sex in the story or no one would like it.  I awaited this production eagerly; having now seen it I feel disgusted and insulted.  If you want to see an intelligent production of the Count of Monte Cristo, avoid this movie like the Black Death. It would be better to lock the DVD in the Chateau D'If. If you haven't read the book, you may enjoy it, since you won't be dissapointed by what is lacking. It does have good scenery and filming, although some of the acting is terrible (Jacopo especially).  To the director and producers
 While this maybe an entertainig movie for the ones who have not read the book, it is an abomination for those of us who cherish one of the world's greatest classics.  It is like Romeo and Juliette getting married and live happily ever after.  There are indeed beautiful scenes, good acting and an appealing story the movie is not really reflecting the book.  I was thoroughly disgusted walking out of the theater. I would very highly recommend the 1974 version with Richard Chaimberlain as a much better film
 If you read and loved the book, then most likely this movie isn't for you.  The only similarities between the two being Dantes imprisonment and escape.  I have yet to see a movie version of the Count of Monte Cristo that gets the story right, the closest being the 1975 Richard Chamberlain version, but even that one had it's flaws.  A summery of this movie would be Edmond Dantes' life is ruined by his greedy friend, but after tweleve years in prison, Dantes comes back, gets his vengence, and Mercedes and his life goes back to how it was twelve years ago.  The book is so much deeper, and this unrealistic fairy tale ending makes the whole movie feel flat.
 I had just finished reading the book and decided I'd like see how it was adapted to the big screen.  This version was the worst adaptation I've seen of a book made into a movie.  As I watched the film I wondered if the makers of the movie even bothered to read the book.  My girlfriend kept asking me during the film if "that happened in the book?"  At the end of the movie I told her that basically everything in the movie was not how it occurred in the book.  She enjoyed the movie until the end when it was like a "cheesy 80's montage".  The book is wonderful.  When I finished reading it, I felt like I had lost a good friend-I wished I could just keep reading it and reading it.  I've never read such an excellent novel.
 Probably the worst re-telling of a great novel I have ever seen. Only scant resemblence to the Dumas book appears in this movie. the screenplay is contrived and the action uneven at best. It's too bad because the actors do a nice job with their roles. This may be an unfair criticism because I couldn't bear to watch this thing to the end. The version with Gerard Depardieu is no more satisfying or faithful to the original source. For the new generation of moviegoers, try to see the made for TV movie with Richard Chamberlain as Dantes. You'll enjoy Alexandre Dumas much more than Alexandre Dumb...
 If you have read Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo then you know that it is a tale that begins but developing the character of Edmond Dantes.  He is a simple man whose main ambition is to marry the beautiful Mercedes.  He proposes to her and on the night of their engagement he is arrested for treason, betrayed by his best friend.  This is a summation of the first chapter.  The second and maybe third chapter relates his time in prison, learning and growing from his relationship with a fellow prisoner.  He also learns from this prisoner the location of a treasure suitable for a dozen kings.  The remaining 90% of the book relates the immensley complicated details of his revenge on those that tore from him the life he held so precious.  It is a tale of intrigue and revenge that takes its time to build and develop.  When you see the traps swinging closed on Dante's enemies you feel a sense of accomplishment with him.  Now, on to the movie.  The first full half of the movie relates Dante's betrayal and captivity.  This leaves only an hour to illustrate his revenge.  What is accomplished is a sad imitation of Alexandre Dumas' master work.  This is one of my favorite books, and one of my least favorite movies.  Hollywood's need for adventure movies to be fast paced to match today's lifestyle has ruined this story for many people.  They just don't know it.
 This was only useable elsewhere. It said wrong area when I inserted it, But Im told it cant be returned if 'opened' I just took off the cellophane. Why agree to sell and post a DVD to the UK when it was impossible to watch?? a big con trick
 It finally arrived after waiting over a month....it was sent with no protective wrapping of any kind and was damaged...as was the case it arrived in...I was very disatisfied and not pleased...from now on I will only order strictly from amazon.
 I ordered a Used-Like New dvd, and the dvd was packaged nicely with a seemingly new and glossed cover. However, after popping it into the dvd player, the movie played till about half of the time and started freezing and showing no picture but sound. I initially thought something was wrong with my dvd player, so I took the dvd to my friends computers, three of them, and the same error showed at the same place in the movie. I was so frustrated because I loved this movie so much that I was so happy to now have an actual dvd copy of it; however, that was a fail. Because it was Used dvd nonetheless, I felt scammed. The sellers must have had checked whether the dvd worked properly or not, but they still sold it--to me. Please check your USED CD/DVDs before reselling it back! In the end, I asked for a refund, and I hope I get it.
 Calling this movie after Alexandre Dumas' original novel is like calling Bernstein's 'West Side Story' 'Romeo and Julliette' after Shakespeare's work. So many elements of the story were altered that Dumas' original plot and theme are no longer recognizable except for the names of some of the characters. They might as well call this film 'The Count of Hollywood' and set the story in modern L.A. instead of 19th century France.    In this film, Dantes is informed of the mission to rescue Napoleon from the onset as opposed to finding about it when returning to shore. Danglars is barely in the picture and is cast as a pirate instead of a banker. Mercedes marries Fernand one month after Dantes is imprisoned instead of 18 months (So much for her loyalty
 This review is not of the movie, which I love and why I want it on bluray, the review is of the actual bluray disc.  I bought the movie and exchanged it twice all for the same problems
 I can't belive they dis such a horrible work on this movie, if they would have stuck to the plot that went on in THE BOOK, you know, where they got the idea from, then the movie would have been a success.  But since hollywood likes to ruin great works of art, then they do what they did with this movie, they BLEW IT!!!! If you really want to get the true feel of The Count Of Monte Cristo,  then READ THE BOOK, YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED THERE.
 Apparently someone who read the book 5 years ago gave the screenwriter a brief rundown on the plot. Holy [cow]. I really enjoyed the book and this was a big letdown.  Huge parts of movie are new, and enormous pieces of the original plot are left out.  It would be one thing if the changes made the transition to film easier, (as with Lord of the Rings), but I don't think they even tried. Dumas is not exactly the most daring or controversial writer; I'm not sure why a perfectly good story, and ending, had to be filled up with enough dairy to rival a cheese castle. If you haven't read the book in a while or at all and you do like this movie, or even if you think it was allright, please take the time to read or review the book. Maybe the makers didn't want to spoil the book for that haven't read it, I'm not sure.  There's much more satisfaction at the end than an illegitimate child and a duel between two people that were never "boyhood friends. As I write this, I am about 500 pages into reading the book.  I decided to watch this because I was certain that, as a major Hollywood production, it would not reveal to me any of the plot I have not yet encountered.  Man, I hate being right sometimes. Scene 1
 Very inferior to the 1975 Richard Chamberlain version. It's as if a chimp took a sledgehammer to the story and knocked all the sense out of it. The characters are dumbed down and the actors are forced into flat caricatures (except for a fine performance by Richard Harris). Caviezal is unable to transform the guileless young Dantes into the dynamic Machiavellian. When he makes his entrance as The Count of Monte Cristo, he limply floats onto the scene and sighs, "Glad you could all make it to my party." Since most of the movie was shot in the dark, there is little for the eyes here. Even the music disappoints.
 After finishing Dumas' classic novel, I immediatly watched this movie. About an hour later, and a hillarious balloon scene, I sadly ejected the DVD, which I now use for a coaster. If you've never read the book, you've got nothing to lose. But if you've ever read the book, you get that sense of annoyance very quickly, and outrage towards the end. Do yourself a favor and read the book first! It is excellent!
 I understand such a huge book can not be transferred wholly to the big screen, but the script deviates drastically from the book in the way it ends. Had i known that, i wouldn't have bought it.  There are some very nice scenes & cinematography.
 This DVD would not play due to parameters.  Read carefully ...REGION 2.  Will not play in America.  Total Fail for me!<a href="http
 Well this is a great movie but have not had the pleasure of getting to watch it because I am out of region. What does that mean anyway!? Not sure but don't buy anything if out of a region cause it won't play. Guess ya live and learn!
 The Count of Monte Cristo in the original book starts off as a young and naive sailor. But the betrayal by his supposed friends and his unjust imprisonment turns him into someone very different.  He presents himself at different times as enigmatic, dangerous, cunning, able to bend criminals to his will and to lure aristocrats into becoming his friend.  He finds out the inner secrets of each of his enemies and turns their weaknesses into their downfall.  This character is perhaps the most romantic in fiction and one of the most complex.  The script does the actors a serious disservice, but a stronger actor in the role of the Count could still have done a good job of showing us the deep undercurrent of anger that drove his actions and made him believable.  Unfortunately, James Caviezel isn't capable of bringing that depth of acting to the role.  The people who enjoyed the mini-series/film either never read the book or have forgotten what it was really like.
 I opened this "new" DVD and it skipped every 20 to 30 seconds throughout the entire movie. I would not recommend buying a DVD from this seller, as it may not work properly.
 The book, The Count of Monte Cristo, is one of my favorites.  I know that movies can miss certain elements in the book and that usually the book is better.  So I can forgive most movies even if they miss some things.  But this movie seems to have missed the point entirely.  It seems that they thought sword fights and one-liners where what this story is about.  Where the book created this fully fleshed world of Edmond Dantes, the movie is like the superficial Hollywood version of the hastily read cliff notes.  If you are looking for a movie that takes the themes from this book accurately, then watch the movie, SLEEPERS.  (with Jason Patrick, Brad Pitt, Robert DeNiro, etc.)  Even though the time and place and people are entirely different, the story of this film rings more true to the heart of the novel, The Count of Monte Cristo, than any film version of the book I've ever seen.  Read the book, and watch both movies and you'll see why.
 For those of you who have read the book (abridged or unabridged), be prepared to be dissapointed!  The only similarity that the movie and the book share is the name itself.  It is a travesty that somebody can re-write a classic literary work into something like a made-for-tv movie!  Check that...there is a made-for-tv series in French (made by Bravo, I believe) that is the closest depiction of The Count of Monte Cristo that I have ever seen.  I would not waste my time watching thismovie!  See the bravo flick...not this one!
 What an unmitigated piece of garbage.  Richard Harris is always wonderful but he's the only redeeming feature of this perverse twisting of Dumas' classic.  See the G&eacute;rard Depardieu mini-series instead.  (If you can ignore the fact that he doesn't look starved in the Chateau d'If, it's wonderful.)  Except for Harris the acting is poor.  The people are unrealistic and are, at best, caricatures of Dumas' creations.  The writer has committed a crime.
 I have a blu-ray player that is a year old.  The firmware is from this year. This is the first blu-ray disc that will not play.  I tried two copies that were in perfect condition.  Do not buy this disk.
 This movie is the events of Dumas' classic stamped onto a canned Hollywood adventure/love story.  The formula is the same used in 80's montage movies
 I had to return this Blue Ray twice and I still don't have a working copy. finaly I told Amazon to refund my purchase. the disc would not play on my new Sony BR player. I updated my firmware and other BR discs played on my player, but I was never able to get this disc to play.
 Why is it that so many filmmakers believe that they can improve upon classic novels by changing them?  Such conceit rarely results in a movie that is a credit to the novel upon which it is based, few surpass the original, and this is certainly no exception. Jim Caviezel is certainly eye candy in this movie, and if you are interested in that, or in seeing a VERY YOUNG Henry Cavill (of the Tudors), then by all means buy this movie.  However, if you want to enjoy "The Count of Monte Cristo," slog through the book.  This is NO substitute.  Most of the plot has been stripped away, and that which remains has been altered beyond recognition.
 This is easily one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Forget that, it's one of the *two* worst movies I've ever seen. While Guy Pearce is usually an excellent actor, and Jim Caviezel has the perfect look for Edmund Dantes (at least, post-imprisonment), there is nothing that could have saved such a woefully terrible screenplay. The Dumas novel is one of the best books I've ever read, filled with intrigue, action, and mystery, with vibrant characters and brilliant plotting. Granted, adapting such a grand story to the screen would probably take four hours or more, but if one isn't going to attempt an adaptation of the original story, then one should just make a new movie. That being said, all the interesting, original parts of the book were removed and replaced with a cookie-cutter revenge plot, stereotypical, one-dimensional characters, and bland dialogue that too often inserts modern slang into Napoleonic-era France. This movie is the "Count of Monte Cristo" in name only, and in every other way, a poorly conceived, vapid, dime-a-dozen action flick. Avoid it at all costs.
 I've been itching to buy this movie since I saw it in the theatre. Now I'm going to have to wait until they release a widescreen version because there's no way I'm paying for pan&scan. A beautifully crafted film both in visuals and acting, not to mention the masterful story telling. The only letdown is not having widescreen, which is unforgivable and therefore this DVD release gets one star, for what would otherwise be a five star rating.
 My only reason for seeing this film is because  Luis Guzman is in it.  I find these Napoleon/Shakespeare/pirate films to very very dull, boring and over-long.    Luis plays a much different role here than what we are use to seeing.  Doesn't he look handsome in that red English coat?
 The DVD was from the wrong region - didn't even know that was possible. So irritated I didn't want to mess with return process.Still don't have my DVD,  ) 
 One thing I want to point out about this documentary is it starts out talking about personal credit card debt and approximately 30 mins into the documentary starts to talk about national debt and how much national debt the U.S. owes. In economics, personal credit card debt and the national debt are two very different issues. I find it dishonest that the filmmakers would mislead consumers by lumping both types of debt together - they are separate issues and need to be addressed as such.  I would agree with the part of the film where it states "debt is a much larger symptom of economic and structural issues facing households" and that "households are facing declining and stagnating incomes while costs are skyrocketing". I certainly agree that public policy must be changed to address such issues, however, the film barely touched upon this topic.  I kept waiting to hear solutions the film would propose to address personal credit card debt in this nation - whether those solutions be on a personal or national level. In the end, the film gave about a 5-minute soundbite on the how this issue needs to be addressed at the community level.  Overall, poorly organized documentary that goes off on tangents. The mention of faith-based solutions at the end without elaborating on what such solutions are rounded off an already weak movie.
 The least informative documentary I have ever seen and I am a career student.  This documentary provided no proof for its claims. All of the claims are backed by indivdual opinions with no creditability. Dont waste your money... Email me and I will mail you my copy.
 I took a chance on this low cost download, hoping the low-budget art-house movie would interest my mind and entertain me.  First, the digital quality forced me to either sit far back or to shrink the image on my screen.  I've have better image quality with VHS videos.  The best attributes of the content were a decent makeup/face of the actor playing the artist, and a plain-looking painted wall in one of the rooms had some 'potential'.  Other than that, there is nothing to interest the viewer visually.  The asylum and people don't look like late 19th Century southern France.  They don't even try to behave, look, or sound French.  Just a little is all that's needed for the viewers imaginations to pick up on something.  No views of the countryside or closeups of anything interesting to set the stage or mood.  Lighting skills were absent.  The entire first 20 minutes could have been just a few lines with some emotion and visuals to set the tone, but rather it's an immense amount of words spoken by the actor either to himself or to someone else.  Worse, the words are like they are read from a poorly written book.  No other conflicts, nothing else going on, and simply no theatrical or cinematic 'artistry'.  After 20 minutes, I fast forwarded to see if anything else happened different, but was disappointed.  I've seen low budget do well before, but this lacks all those little elements that are needed to make it something entertaining.
 The actor playing Van Gogh has the mannerisms and speech patterns of Woody Allen. It's the worst acting I've ever seen, and there's nothing else to focus on, as the film is nothing but a series of hallucinated conversations interrupted by stuttering, hand-wringing monologues.
 the stream was pixelated and kept on stopping and starting. There was no smooth stream. I tried to watch it at different times on 2 different computers same results
 If you thought "Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla had to be the worst Sammy Petrillo movie, think again. In 2007 I said of Petrillo's performance in that vastly better (!) production "...be advised that Sammy Petrillo may be the most annoying man in show business, and in retrospect that was generous. "Keyholes are for Peeping features Petrillo in a dual role
 Imagine you are a woman living in the United States, and a foreign fighter (Pick any of the convenient enemies - The Soviets, Al Qaida, The French, etc) invades your town, killing your husband and trying to destroy your very way of life.  Imagine again, that within 6 months, he has learned everything there is to know about being an American, and has embraced the American culture and now becomes a leader in the fight against his own countrymen. So dedicated is he to his new "family", that he even goes into battle wearing your dead husband's uniform.  Did I mention that you have fallen madly in love with him?  If this sounds too far-fetched to be true, imagine the same story, only you are Japanese, a race and culture renowned for excluding outsiders and foreigners, as well as a culture that is almost impenetrable in its subtlety.  Unbelieveable, isn't it? Apparently, not if you're Tom Cruise.
 "Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure" March 4, 2004 "Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure", is a simple way to describe this movie. I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I not only admire Edward Zwick's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely "factless". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, They at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered "RONIN" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means "To serve" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms, it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century, the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors The real history of Japan. I would like to add that the Chinese feel Honoring the Samurai and Japanese values is like Honoring Nazis and their way of life and I don't blame them for feeling that way considering there History.
 This film is an absolute load of steamer.  I died laughing watching it at the theater, and then again when i saw it on dvd. Tom Cruise, arguably the most over-rated actor in the past 50 years, would have been waxed in the scene where he is taken hostage to start with.  the very ethic the movie takes such pains to over-illustrate would have had it no other way. the japanese guys did a decent job, but i couldn't help but think they were just there to cash hollywood checks.  It is rather like when American actors come to Japan to do a friggin car commercial.  There is no critical fallout, so why bother?  Why indeed.
 Oh how I wish I could spend three months in the mountains and come out speaking flawless Japanese... -__-   This film is one of those ones that aspires to show everyone in a politically correct light and ruthlessly employs stereotypes galore to attempt to do it. The noble white man comes to the tiny idyllic remote village and is reformed and turned to the way of bushido by the kind and benevolent natives who come to respect him too. Even gets to fall in love with the demure  ;perfect ; widow of the man he killed. And on top of that, he manages to change the mind of the emperor! How far we've come in making films that don't depict Asian stereotypes. -_-   The historical problems with this film are huge, but then again it didn't claim to be a documentary. The real problems lie in the representation of women, and the romantization of the culture (everything from bushido to the army).   There are some redeeming qualities, which include Ken Watanabe's excellent performance, and the beautiful and lush scenery/clothing which was relatively authentic. (I know most of this was shot in Canada...but the set pieces were very well researched)   If you want a film with substance, start checking out films from people actually from Japan. Zatoichi, and Twilight Samurai (both currently playing in select cities) come to mind, or any of the works of Akira Kurosawa.   Or for a different spin with beautiful visuals, check out China's Hero (soon to be released on the big screen here).
 Decent acting, decent actors, terrible writting, no research into Japanese customs whatsoever, almost as insulting as  ;Rising Sun. ;  Waste of over two hours.
 Samurai were not that stupid. I don't particularly like some aspects of classic Japanese culture (excessive obsession over honor and conformity), but the one thing they do better than most other Asian cultures is adapt military technologies when given the opportunity.  To imply that there was a group of Japanese Samurai who refused to use fire-arms is retarded. The Japanese have used guns since they first encountered them from the Europeans in the early 1400's, from these they reverse engineered. Japanese Warlords have won the entire country with rifle-men.  Historically, there really were a group of samurai who rebelled against a modernizing Japan. And they really did fight to death. And they really did only used swords.  But not due to a retarded dogmatic aversion to guns, but because they ran out of gun-powder in their last battle.  Also the idea that the last and only surviving samurai would be a white man is insulting.
 I held this one off for a long time. I was at the very bottom of my list of movies to see. I just knew it was gonna be trash. Aside from some breathtaking photography this film is dumbed down Hollywood trash. An insult to Japanese filmakers like Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) and Hiroshi Inagaki (Samurai Trilogy) who's Samurai films have captured the hearts of audeinces worldwide.  Not only is this film a rip off of those directors but it's also a poor attempt at mimicing Hollywood epics like Braveheart. Probably the worst thing about this film is Tom Cruise's occaisional narration of his diary. What kind of warrior keeps a diary anyway? Isn't that for pansies? Anyway it serves as pointless drivel that mearly point's out the allready obvious. It's like they tried to make this film idiot proof. I think they should have focused on making it average joe/jane pissed off cause they spent 5 bucks to rent this crap proof.   The Characater development in this film was pretty much the same any Jean Claued Van Damme film. Last time I checked  ;Kickboxer ; or  ;Bloodsport ; didn't get nominated for any Academy Awards. I was just waiting for a training montage.  That's all I'm gonna write about this film. I have better stuff to review.
 This film fails both historically and morally.   The real Imperial Army was not inept and cowardly as shown in this film.  Every Japanese history textbook I've ever read says that the conscript soldiers were disdained by the haughty samurai, but that they proved their bravery and worth in the battles against them.  There's nothing in this film that shows the arrogance and contempt the samurai had for the  ;dirt farmers ; whom they expected to easily defeat, but who stood their ground and shot them to pieces.  The samurai, incidentally, had just as many cannons and muskets as their opponents.  I cannot understand why the filmmaker had to make the samurai's enemies so evil and stupid, instead of portraying the war as a sincere clash of cultures between men who fought for what they belived in.   Morally, it really hurt me to see Tom Cruise (Algren) wading so cold-bloodedly into the teenage troops he had been training six months ago and butchering them without the slightest compunction.  And there wasn't even any sort of remorse voiced by Cruise/Algren, even in a cliched, off-the-cuff sort of way ( ;Many brave men on both sides will die today. ;).  Maybe he hacked to death that poor, scared man he was trying to teach how to shoot earlier in the film.   This is one of those films that, like  ;The Patriot ;, gets every cuff button and chin-strap of the costumes right, but fails to capture the spirit of an era and its people by resorting to black-and-white/good-and-evil cliches.  It looks geat, but has a rotten core.
 Apart from being slow, condescending, cliched and overblown, this film is hilarously, and unintentionally ironic. An American from an American-backed 'peace keeping force' joins with a bunch of reactionary rebels. Amazingly, the rebels are right to despise 'western ways' in their desire to cling to 'traditional' beliefs. Guns, progress and capitalism aren't, apparently, the basis for inner peace. In the face of impossible odds, it's still better to die an honourable death in the face of automatic weapons. So, presumably, the follow up will be something like 'Last Jihad Warrior' where Tom Cruise joins the Iraqi Shi'ite militia in a vainglorious rebellion against Apache attack helicopters.
 (...) Haters of Western Culture have no fear
 At every opportunity this movie failed in the presentation of its larger themes.  To begin with, the presentation of honor, as illustrated through the statements and military tactics of the rebel samurai leader, demonstrated a grotesque misunderstanding of the term.  The idea that honor somehow requires a military leader to ignore cutting edge military technology, i.e. firearms, or to blindly charge forward at a numerically superior and better armed foe is laughable.  Furthermore, the healing power of love can hardly be demonstrated by a widow who jumps in bed with her husband's killer before his corpse is even cold, even if the killer is Tom Cruise.  On a side note, I could hardly restrain my laughter when Cruise's character appears in the doorway of the widow's house wearing her husband's armor.  Regarding the below comments about the racially insensitive aspects of this movie, I completely agree.  If I was Japanese, I would be annoyed at how Tom Cruise's American character, after spending only a short time in the samurai village, ultimately holds himself out to be the highest exponent of the samurai virtues and then presumes to instruct the Emperor on how to act.  I get hot under the collar when Europeans comment about how Americans should act or vote.  I can only imagine that people of Japanese citizenship or descent would have a similar reaction to the manner in which samurai culture was depicted in this film.
 Wonderful movie, one of the best you'll ever experience and since most reviewers wrote a lot about this movie I won't.  The DVD was very disappointing to me because this movie was based on Japan and it's history, however, it doesn't offer you to watch the movie in Japanese or it doesn't even offer the Japanese subtitle!!!  They offer the typical, Spanish and French!  It would have improved this DVD greatly if they had an option to either watch it in Japanese or to watch it with Japanese subtitle.
 No wonder the Japanese people hate this movie.  It's not only the stereotypes (most of the Japanese characters were faceless or ugly, and in general violent and, hmm, stereotyped).  It's also the pretentious way of fitting an Oriental philosophy in a Westerner's world.  I'm not against meshing the best of different worlds.  I'm just saying the novel and the movie are purely made to make money, and there's nothing philosophical or endearing about the story or the main character.  Of course, it has to end with the white man taking the Asian woman as his bride.  No wonder the Japanese hate this movie.
 "Not Real History But A Fun Fantasy Adventure", is a simple way to describe this movie. I was very excited to hear this movie was coming out. I have written several papers on the subject and not only admire Edward Zwick's other movies but I am a Tom Cruise fan as well. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the movie, Tom Cruise was fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful but the film is almost completely "factless". America did open up trade with Japan but French and German officers trained the Japanese imperial army, they at the time had the best Foot soldiers. Also the young Emperor of Japan was not torn between the new and old ways, He instead was the driving force behind modernizing Japan as fast as it did, he saw the Samurai as one of the main reasons Japan had fallen so far behind. The Samurai that rebelled against the Emperor were considered "RONIN" meaning Samurai with no master, and sense Samurai means "To serve" they were despised by the Samurai that served the Emperor and were perceived as Dishonorable. The rebel Samurai also had full divisions that used Firearms; it was not the Bows vs. Rifles you see in the movie. And most importantly it was not the Honorable Samurai protecting the Peasant people from the heartless new way of the Evil imperial Japanese Government, quit the opposite is true. Japan had been divided for more then a century; the clans had known nothing but war. When the Shogun took power the Emperor was nothing more then a symbol and was never allowed to leave his Palace. The Shogun had the real power and the whole time it was most of Japan, the peasants and working class that suffered under the Samurai, They were Honorable warriors but only to other Samurai, ordinary Japanese were considered Less then Men and could be killed at the whims of the Samurai. It was the modernization of Japan that threatened the rule of the Samurai with the Shogun being forced to step down in 1867 and put the power back in the hands of the Emperor as well as the working class of Japan. Most Samurai saw this and surrendered the old way to the new seeing that The Samurai were obsolete, but the few that rebelled were motivated by Power, status and wealth that they were losing and not for the People of Japan like the film so badly suggests. This is a fun film if you watch it as a fantasy adventure with no basis in history. I give it a low rating because even thought both Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick admit that this is not what really happened but wanted to capture the spirit of the Samurai in a fiction film, I feel this is irresponsible and that this film dishonors the real history of Japan.
 In terms of history, thie movie is a fiction, but it succeed in explaining the main idea of samurai spirit. I like it.

 This movie was filmed in Australia and not like Japan at all, there is even scene with coconut tree! This movie is Japan from eyes of American, not bushido, NOT TRUE SAMURAI, not the heart of Japan. Japanese emperor and bushido are not heterogenous, this movie mislead of Japan conception. Why ninja attacking village? Was this still playing active part in Japan which became Meiji? -No. The scene when children eat meal without having a rice bowl in left hand, this is very ill mannered in Japanese meal, and this also Samurai's child? -No. To say "This Hollywood film drew the heart of Japan or samurai correctly" is profanity to the samurai who fought for the resturation of Japan. --- A rental is enough, I think we see only one time even if we buy it.
 yawn.....  anything happen?  no?  ok yawn....
 I knew what sort of film to expect when I pressed play but this film I thought was quite poor, a huge let down. Anyone familiar with Japanese history would I think feel "is it necessary to make up a fictional character from scratch to give an account of when the samurai became obsolete as a class when "real" characters from history could be deployed?". If hollywood wanted to make a film about how the samurai mode of fighting was becoming outmoded then they could have used characters like Isami Kondou instead of Katsumoto.
 I first saw this movie in 05 after everyone I knew who'd seen it said it was awesome.  However I had the exact opposite reaction to this movie.  Other reviewers have pointed out many ridiculous things about this movie.  Here are the ones I think are the most prevalent. 1. The historical and cultural reality of this movie is flipped to where the dwindling noble samurai are the good guys and the big mean Japanese government advised by the dastardly US is the bad guy. 2. The time it takes Tom Cruise to learn the "ways" of the samurai is extremely short, and the Samurai people he lives among, for the most part, seem to not have a problem with this outsider, despite their history of not accepting people outside of Japan. 3. It is in your face about the Indian Wars and the atrocities the "white man" inflicted on the Native Americans, and how US influence in Japan was evil and sinister in nature.  Not to mention it "corrupts" the culture that was once innocent in it's lack of industrialization and modern technology.  another stupid thing that others have pointed out is how the samurai are portrayed as only using the archaic sword and bow, while the evil government uses modern mechanized weapons.  This is BS, because the Samurai had been using guns since the 1600s just like much of the world.  This is typical for movies like it.  The poor weak natives who are nice to the earth and use thing that don't do little to no harm to the planet, while the big evil bad guys don't care and whatever they want to the earth.  I'm not necessarily saying they did this on purpose, but it is typical.  In closing, this movie sucks! It's an overly used storyline that is exactly like  Dances With Wolves, Avatar, ect.  The only difference being it's set in Japan. Even at 16 when I first saw The Last Samurai I abhorred it, and five year later I  still can honestly say the same.
 In the 19th Century Japan became part of the world. For hundreds of years the country was ruled by a prime minister who had the title of Shogun. His rule was backed by a feudal system of armed nobles who had retinues of hereditory warriors called samurai. Samurai were of noble birth and trained in both warrior skills and an ideology of warfare. The 19th Century saw the Emperor of Japan sieze power from the Shogun and to end the feudal system creating a conscript army and a modern navy. To do this he imported overseas advisors, Prussians to train the army British and French to help with the navy. The change to the power structure lead to a revolt of the samurai class upset at the loss of their traditional privalages. This film is about this revolt. Being an American film the action is seen through the prism of an American officer. This of course is the first point at which we move into the land of fairy tale. At the time of the events of this film America had a small army of no great reputation. However probably Tom Cruise does a poor German accent.  Rather than being a drama about what happened the film is about the Tom Cruise character. That is a person who has had his soul destroyed as he has been part of a massacre of Indian women and children. This has turned him into an alcoholic who is drifting through life. In this film he is redeemed.  He is captured by the samurai in a battle and then kept prisoner in a remote village for the winter. In his time he becomes a convert to the samurai life style and decides to switch sides in the last epic pointless battle to keep the feudal system going in Japan. In this way he redeams himself and heal the pain of the massacre. He is also able to kill the American officer who commanded him to kill the native Americans.  The film is gratutously insluting to important figures in Japanese history. The emperor Meiji who was responsible for modernising his country is portrayed instead as a figure of self confidence and vision, as a dithering boy who needs Tom Cruise to help him discover the true values of his country. Cruise in talking to his feudal buddies the Samurai immediately takes on a leadership role planning the last idiotic battle and gives them tiresome lectures about the wars between the Greeks and the Persians.  The film is not only laboured and tiresome it is reflective of American hubris and is unhistoric in putting them at the centre of events they had no part in.
 He goes over to Japan to assert his Western superiority, learns some fancy swordplay but never becomes a Samurai because he's not as good as the Japanese. And all his Western battle strategies fail, so some of the Samurais want to kill him but there's this one well-respected Japanese Samurai who teaches him to be Japanese, houses him, clothes him, and treats him like a brother.  So in a heat of battle when Tom can't hold his own against the enemy the Japanese Samurai has to step in to save Tom's life thus showing him who's the real deal.  This samurai also gets all the Japanese women and they all hate Tom and treat him like the foreign freak that he is so he's lonely and ends up with Penelope Cruz, who happens to be a missionary teaching the Japanese about Christianity.  But then Tom finds out that Penelope actually loves the Japanese Samurai who saved his life and is just being friendly to Tom out of pity.  Tom is angry about this because he can't get any from the Japanese women or Penelope so he turns against this Japanese Samurai who helped him out through thick and thin and challenges him to a sword duel.  So in the sword duel, the Japanese Samurai out duels him but since the Japanese Samurai isn't a killing freak, he stops short of killing him and gives him the ultimatum to leave Japan.  So wounded, Tom limps towards a boat, then you see him mutter, "Friggin' Japs...." turn around and shoots the good caring Japanese Samurai in the shoulder!  Unfazed, the Japanese samurai gets back up and charges towards Tom with his sword as Tom is frantically trying to reload his gun to light the fuse to take a second shot at the samurai. Just as Tom is about to point the gun in the Japanese samurai's face to blow it off, the Japanese Samurai slices the gun in half (fantastic symbolism of Eastern culture defeating evil Western culture) and delivers the deathblow!  Finally, Tom is on the pier, bleeding to death and says" I...I just wanted to be like you...a brave, noble Samurai...but...but was to weak...forgive me...." and dies.

 The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves.  Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism.  At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.  Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right.  The samurai preyed on the peasants.  Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed.  When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.  The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history.  Avoid it like the plague.
 I hate this film very much.  One of the worst movie I have ever seen.  The last battle field is totally ridiculous; yes, R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S.  All the samurai are killed (in such a way) except Tom Cruise (still alive)?!?!?!  How many people can survive such an attack (heavy open fire) if this was real?  I was amazed to see Tom Cruise walking into the Emperor Meiji's chamber and proudly presented himself as the last samurai the end of the film.  What the heck?  This film should be -3,000,000,000,000,000 stars!  Grrrrrrr!!!
 Yes I thought this movie was alright when I first saw it and I kept thinking that the story was vaguely familiar and then it hit me replace the samurai with Indians and Tom Cruise with Mel Gibson and you've basically got dances with wolves. this movie is a rip off and completely unoriginal.
 I thought the film itself was exellent.  Tom Cruise was very commendable is his role, and the action sequences were stunning.  Disregard my one star rating in that sense, and buy the film today!  My problem is the fact that there had to be an American in it at all.  Will a film flop if there isn't a white face on screen?  Being a big fan of "The Seven Samurai", I was in awe when I discovered that a modern film about samurai was hitting the big screen.  My anticipation was short-lived, however, when I realised the film focuses entirely on Tom Cruise, and he just had to be AMERICAN!  He's even the sole survivor of the end battle, a battle which did occur, but he certainly wasn't there!  Why not have a British or Portuguese, or Dutch character (nations that all were thoroughly involved with Japan at the time) if there has to be a caucasian?  This just reflects the shallowness of American audiences, I'm afraid...  (I'll probably get negative responses for this review, but please don't misunderstand me.  I think Americans are cool!)
 Samurai as good, honourable soldier who hold onto traditional value is like sharks in Finding Nemo who are vegetarian.  It is totally FAKE. Samurai are in essense ultra-loyal soldiers for Japanese Emperior.  Chinese and rest of Asia knows very well that these are people who kills civillians, children, women and anyone else if the Emperior ask them too.  Modernise or not is just the weapon they take up, not the mentality they have.   I am so sorry and angry that Hollywood have continued to romantize the 'Japanese value'.  Don't you people knows Japanese soldiers were like NAZI in Asia in World War? Even worse, they never apologize for their wrong during the war. They portrait themselves as survivors of the atomic bombs, victims of the wars when they are the PREDATORS who invade other countries in the first place Why can they get away with this? That's because the West are so impressed by the Samuria code of HONOUR to realize it is exactly this code of unquestionable loyalty that cause so much suffering over Asia. The Last Samurai may be an epic and Tom Cruise may have made Oscar worthy performance but would you honour a film portraiting how loyal Nazi was to Hitler or how English soldiers bravely killing Native Americans ?

 This is the most upseting movie I have ever watched in my life. I was brought to tears long after the movie was through. And why people like this movie is beyond me. How is it that so many movies follow the same paths? The last of the Mohicans, Dances with Wolves, The hunted, The Mexican...I mean what's up? These movie really do ponder the white man's ego. How is it that at the end of the battle scene Tom Cruise is left alive while the rest of the samurai were massacred? How? Tell me. And how is it that Taka and her children fell in love with the man that murdered the most important man of their lives. And people claim this is such an amazing tribute to the Japanese culture. Thats to someone that is completely ignorant. First off, a person should already be proud of their heritage, and what great tribute is there? Sure they make the samurai seem like peaceful people, but why then is it that a foriegner that learned little in a few months was able to survive and become the last samurai. It was all BS. This was one of the most hurtful movies that I have ever watched in my entire life. And I pity anyone that thought this movie was great. I feel sorry for every culture out there that was ever massacred by the American films. A person will never truly understand until it hits them. How would someone like it if Uma Thurman was the Last Pinay, or Charlize Theron was the Last Indian, or Tobey Mcguire was the Last Mexican, or Eminem is the Next 2pac, etc. No one would like it one bit. I bet if somewhere in Asia they made some Asian man the Last of the Americans, everyone would hate it forever. Everyone would murder those movies. But no one ever stops to think about how hurtful such a  ;wonderful ; movie can be. So next time you think this movie is so great and you think people are overreacting, ask yourself this, how would you feel if you were in their place?
 The Last Samurai is a movie that erroneously glorifies Japanese history and some of its worst aspects.  Loosely based on fact, the real last samurai, Saigo Takamori, that this movie is based on was a terrible murderer who held tightly to an incredibly conservative viewpoint (translation
 I had high hopes, like many, going into this film. As a fan of the franchise, I was looking forward to that "blown out of my seat experience the other films of this saga have given me. Besides which, this is the film we've all been waiting for since the beginning, right? The future war! The resistance vs. Skynet! It couldn't possibly be bad, could it? Oh, you couldn't be more wrong!  This film lacked anything in the way of atmosphere or suspense. The mood of the film was extremely flat from almost the start and never really came to life. On top of that, I feel too much time was spent on the machines and not enough on John Connor and the humans (whom you'd think we should be rooting for). Sam Worthington's character, of the man made into a machine, never gained any sympathy or interest from me. The fact they gave away the "secret to his character in the trailers, certainly didn't help that, either. His character's actions are schizophrenic, at best, half the time making little sense, if any, and almost never ring true. A major flaw, to be sure, with how much time he gets on screen. And where is the dark dystopian world, filled with death and destruction? One where humans are an endangered species, that are the prey to the machines that now rule? The glimpses we've seen in the past films are completely ignored here, which hurts the continuity of the franchise and this film's place within it.  Then you have Christian Bale, who plays John Connor as a "Batman-lite affair. He uses the same kind of voice here, that he did in "The Dark Knight and it just doesn't work. He portrays none of the charisma and leadership that we know the character is supposed to have. All the emotions we've felt for him in the past are all stripped away here, as he comes off like a whiny and self-absorbed jerk. Hardly one you'd want being the savior of the human race. None of the other resistance members get enough screen time to make any kind of impression on you, so you never develop any bond in what might happen to them. I don't know if the cast just didn't care about the film, or if the script just gave them nothing to work with, but there is no fire in any of the performances.  And even if the script doesn't let the actors down, it has more than a few problems itself. They never really explain why Sam Worthington's character is the one chosen by Skynet. The story never gives you any feelings of dread or panic, despite tons of action on the screen. And while those action sequences are well shot and choreographed, they lack any real excitement. It never gets your pulse pounding. Plus there are tons of little things in the film, like Connor's wife being pregnant, which get no explanation or even a passing mention. I mean, what's the point in doing that, if it doesn't mean anything? And why is Skynet herding people into camps (ala the Nazis)? Shouldn't it simply be destroying all human life, to protect itself and win the war? It is another plot point that makes no sense, nor is given any reasoning for, in a script filled with them. Worst of all, and the one major flaw that ruins the whole film for me, is how, after Skynet has captured Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, in one of the few decent performances in the film), it doesn't kill him immediately, but uses him as bait to lure John Connor into a rescue mission. This kind of thinking, in terms of revenge and greed, is an emotional human failing Skynet should not have. It is a machine. It should know the simple equation
 T2 is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made - it's layered with modern themes, awesome action, and inspired performances from Hamilton, Furlong, and Morton. Cameron is a jerk, but his directing is intense - we rarely see such daring REAL stunt work anymore. Outside of that, Terminator
 I'm a fan of the first two Terminator films.  T2 is a brilliant piece of cinema, in terms of both special effects and plot.  The character development in the script, and the subsequent performances by the actors, was leveraged superbly by director and franchise creator Jim Cameron.  Even Ah-nold kept it together enough to portray a cyborg as something more than a one-dimensional machine.  So it was with some anticipation that I purchased the (hopefully) LAST installment in the Terminator franchise
 In terms of big Hollywood movies, I feel like there are 2 kinds of bad movies
 Besides all of the regular broken things you hear about this movie...  The voice recordings of Sarah Connor were dull and impassive. They sounded like a school teacher discussing apples or oranges for lunch. They lacked a passionate or fiery edge (yes even in their vocies) as shown by Linda Hamilton from T2 or Lena Headey from TSCC? Oh wait, Linda Hamilton's voice was used... and she read her lines how the director wanted her to read them.  John Connor did nothing for this story, his parts could have been all in the background and it wouldn't of impacted the storyline in any way.  Continuity and Common sense were ignored
 Well, there's nothing like destroying a franchise, is there? Take two of science fiction and Hollywood's most beloved movies, remove everything that was ever good about them and flush them down the toilet - and Jim Cameron's not even dead yet. I love - LOVE - the originals and it pains me to watch my adoptive children get the George Lucas treatment. Let me count the ways in which this film will be remembered as one of the bedrock events in the destruction of storytelling and a critical step towards Michael Bay receiving the Nobel Peace prize and Best Screenplay Oscar in 2020.  I knew from the beginning it didn't look good from having a director called McG - Mr T was the last three-lettered celebrity I can remember but at least he didn't try to direct a film. When Helena Bonham Carter showed up as the stereotyped terminal cancer patient, I knew we were in trouble. And then Sam Worthington showed up (the Gene Hackman of our times, appearing in about 10% of all films currently being made) and couldn't decide on an American or Australian accent for the duration of the shoot. Fortunately, it's not too noticeable since Christian Bale's Batman growl steals the show.  If you can cast your mind back to the legitimate Terminator films, one of the rules is that bullets don't tend to do much damage to Terminators whereas molten steel is a pretty effective way in taking one out. In this film, it's the reverse - Christian Bale takes out a T-800 with a machine gun but fails to destroy one with molten steel. Go figure. And that's the most faithful this film gets to the originals.  Then there's a whole bunch of new characters introduced that nobody cares about and they attempt to recycle some of the iconic dialog ("Come with me if you want to live," to which the only response is "If the rest of the film is this bad, I'll stay here.")  Back to the bad and broken logic, Skynet is no longer trying to exterminate people but rather farm them for some reason that doesn't make any sense. It turns out that Sam Worthington is 50% Terminator too but by the time we find out, it's no surprise because we saw it in the trailer. More of a surprise is the massive Transformers-style bot that's incredibly bad at catching people. And then there's the even bigger surprise of the motorcycle-shaped Terminator that takes a USB Flash drive - thank God the USB2.0 protocol survived the war.  At some point Bryce Dallas Howard shows up, thankful that she's in something marginally better than Lady in the Water. Apparently, Claire Danes is still recovering from embarrassing herself in Terminator 3 and couldn't bring herself to this horror show. I don't really remember why she's there.  Anyway, plot-wise we get into some really convoluted plan by the machines that makes the average episode of Murder She Wrote look like Agatha Christie. They build this half-human-slash-cyborg thing to lure out John Connor when the real thing was infinitely more effective (or they could have just killed his father when they held him in the farm). Skynet is apparently running Windows ME since their strategic logic wouldn't win a chess game let alone Future War.  The ending - slight SPOILER ALERT here - is so far-fetched I had to rewatch a Christopher Nolan film to bring back my faith in the movie industry. There's a heart transplant surgery that would make a daytime soap opera blush and literally I was ready to head out for a beer when it happened.  So sorry for the rant but the first Terminator films are largely responsible for my love of movies and McG just did the worst possible job. Terminator 3 was possible to ignore but Terminator Salvation leaves my brain rocking back and forth in my head trying to make sense of the whole thing. As far as I'm concerned, this story ended perfectly when Arnold was lowered into the molten steel and that's the end of it.  If you remember how thrilled you were when first seeing Terminator 2, do yourself a favor and relive that film rather than having it trashed by this one. And I didn't even get to tell you how bad the pointless CGI Arnie looked but apparently it cost a *lot* of money.
 This isn't a real movie. There's no storyline, just a bunch of scenes that appear to lurch toward no conclusion whatsoever. No two plot points match, no human motivation appears to animate this cast of losers. No effort at all was expended on anything beyong stealing your money and wasting your time.  The unfathomable star power of Christian Bale, whose last credible performance was the lead in Empire of the Sun, was exploited to the hilt here. Bale has evolved perfect mastery of two acting modes, and only two
 If what you look for in a movie is a bunch of generic people spouting a bunch of generic duologue, this is the movie for you!  None of the charm, subtlety, depth, or focus of the first two Terminator's (or, dare I say, even the third) survived this adaptation. The locations are stale and lifeless, the people are as robotic and artificial as the CGI robots they're fighting, and only name recognition gives us any indication that this is even related to the original movies. I don't like any of these people, I don't care about any of these people, I'm not interested.  In the first three movies we got the sense that the protagonists were running away from a powerful and malevolent menace. Attempting to survive an implacable foe, in order to achieve a goal that meant the difference between humanity's survival and its annihilation. But here, the wooden, generic pod people run from a summer action blockbuster in order to survive long enough to set up another special effects shot.  Some lip service is given to the the issue of "identity" "choice" "free will" and "prejudice" but it's underused and unconvincing. It comes off as an attempt to 'remind' the audience that "Terminator" is about ideas, rather than actually presenting them.  The most I can say about this movie is that, as you watch it, you will quickly feel (as i did) as though you might as well be watching anything.
 This movie is so massively wrong-headed, and so overtly throws sod on the original Terminator film, that I can only assume it's deliberate.  I can only conclude that director McG and the small army of writers who held this film in development hell for several years purposely want to sour you and me on James Cameron's 1984 classic.  What other explanation can there be for such transparent awfulness?  Deep in the violence of post-nuclear 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) struggles as a low-ranking officer in the Resistance.  Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), executed by the state fifteen years earlier, awakes not one day older, already in the thick of fighting.  But in a matter of hours, Wright finds the one thing both the Machines and Connor need
 I was a big fan of the franchise but this really is not part of it. Unlike all the other films, it lacks a story, or even characters you care about. Hard to imagine since it is based on franchise with characters you DO care about. But the truly talentless MTV director McG (and whoever wrote this confusing dark mess of a script) shows his only skill is stringing together a bunch of explosions and fight scenes.  One of the first problems is the John Conner character and the terminator prototype character look so much alike, it's hard to tell who is who through much of the movie, especially since it is mostly shot in dark, grimy locales. Second big problem -- a complete lack of humor or heart. Totally cardboard characters that its hard to care anything about. Third problem -- the ending sequence is ludicrous. So many holes there it's hard to know where to begin.  So here's the deal. You like lots of explosions and fights -- go for it. Lots of that here. You want a movie that makes sense or has any sort of connection to the original Terminator movies, forget it.
 Can someone tell me what this movie was about? The plot (if there WAS one) was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again (and have done) in spite of Edward Furlong's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor. There's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED. One HUGE disappointment. Sorry - I WON'T "be back" if this is the best they can do!!
 The movie is not what I have come to expect from a terminator movie.  I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen.  That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action.  I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.  The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence.  How he sent his father back to his mom.  And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'.  Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing.  I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion.  Just don't expect any action.  It's not a `fun' kill em' all kind of film; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip.
 First off, I can't say Sam Worthington represented a big shock when it turned out he was a Terminator. I mean, they made him up to look like the offspring of a marriage between the original two terminators! They might as well have hung a sign on him!  This film is the silliest and most muddled thing I have ever seen. I call this kind of garbage a "gelquel", because it isn't prequel and it isn't sequel except in actual time. To be brief
 Who is this McG dude again? Oh right, he's some douche bag with a ridiculous moniker (McG??????) and has only directed a handful of movies and a couple rap videos. Yep, that's right, we have a guy with almost no experience in film directing a film in a franchise that's very easy to screw up
 This episode in the Terminator franchise amounts to nothing more than a music video/video game. It's awful.  It is so far from the 1984 original version in both spirit and style that it may well be a film totally separate from the Terminator. McG, besides having a ridiculous moniker, is a terrible director. He makes Michael Bay look like an artist. The director does not have respect for the moviegoer with adolescent kids shooting Remmington 870s one-handed, rock music inserted into various scenes, exotic chesty babes with hair cascading from their helmets, 20 story robots sneaking up behind victims, to a megalomaniac actor rehashing his Batman demeanor.  Suck defined. A Terminator fan will watch, and will know how awful this film is. Everyone else
 Blu-ray gets a 2 disc director's cut while dvd gets only a pos single disc with only the theatrical cut.  Getting tired of having some studios try to shove blu ray down my throat by withholding all good special features and added footage.  DVD is still the top selling format.  Wish they'd just give us the quality of discs we used to get.
 What's going on?  Why should I care about these characters?  Then I found myself asking why I even care how it ends.  Seriously, try to see this movie without any additional incremental out-of-pocket expenses before you plunk down real money and take up valuable DVD shelf space.
 This movie totally sucks.  I felt like I was watching Transformers or some other stupid movie.  No Arnold; No linda.  Did the people making this movie ever see the 1984 original Terminator movie; I think not.  C'mon terminator motorcycles and water creatures?? What's up with that?  The only interesting part of the movie was a truely unique 1 of a kind terminator; interesting concept but the whole idea could have been better developed. Total waste of time and money.  Skip this at all costs if you are a Terminator fan.  If you like cheap sci-fi flicks and/or Transformers then this is right up your alley.  I only give it 1 star because I can't give it a Zero
 They should have stopped at T2, but the cash cow can always be milked to death. I loved the first 2, but they went downhill from there. From T1 Kyle Reese said the first terminators had rubber skin, and were easy to spot. In this one they have never even seen a terminator with skin on it, rubber or real.There were many plot holes and really bad cheesiness like" Oh his heart cant take it." "Then please take mine." So if you like your action dark and hard to see with some big explosions added in. Mix in no plot or characters that you give a rats ass about. Then this is the movie for you.
 The movie gets one star only because I can't give it less. Transformers was Shakespeare in terms of writing compared to this crap. Was this written and edited by a 12 year old?  Or is this the mean mentality they think viewers have?  The previous Ts were enjoyable movies because they didn't expect a lot of you and you didn't expect a lot from them and they did not insult your intelligence -- they kept it simple.  If you haven't figured it out in the first 10 minutes, the moment you see Michael Ironside you should have a clear idea of what you are in for. This movie sucks, simple as that.  The writing is beyond poor, I am shocked this has been positively reviewed at all. Did people see a different movie than I did?  In this movie
 As much hype as this film got, especially the nonsense with Christian Bale berating a lighting guy for causing him to fluff his dialogue during a scene, it didn't even come close to being half way  decent.   The high hopes Halcyon had for this film fell way short and actually caused their demise, disappointing fans that have eagerly awaited the future war for over twenty years.   The only way this franchise will ever survive is to get back to the original plot basics, bring Cameron back on board, much like Ridley Scot has just done with Alien and give the die hard fans what they want.
 If you want to watch a great movie where things blow up, watch "Transformers" as at least it's more colorful and exciting. If you want to watch a great Christian Bale movie, watch "The Dark Knight" or "Batman Begins." If you want to watch a great robot movie, watch "Wall*E." If you want to watch a great Terminator movie, watch one of the first two.  This lousy excuse for an action film fails in every way, creating a "story" that is solely meant to cash in on the word "Terminator."  Watching it feels like being stuck watching someone you don't like playing a video game that you don't like.  I wouldn't take this movie if they offered it for free.  If you're a die-hard fan of the original series, you will be extremely let down, but fortunate to not have paid money to see this in theaters (like I did.)  You can disagree with me if you'd like, but if you do, you obviously would not have seen many other action movies and certainly never have seen the original two films.  Even the short-lived FOX television show was better.  You've been warned.
 The digital copy included in the set expired in April 2010.  I just purchased it for the holidays.  I would not have purchased this set if I had known.  Now that it's open it can't be returned.
 Let me start off by saying that I rarely write negative reviews on Amazon.  Although I don't write that many reviews here, I prefer to spend my time writing reviews about items, movies and music that I really like that I think will be helpful to others.  That being said, this movie is so awful, I felt compelled to write about it here.  I'm a HUGE fan of the first two Terminator movies.  They both certainly rank in my top movies of all time, so I was really excited to see this latest installment.  Oh man, I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  Extremely thin storyline, no new twist, horrendous amateur acting, woeful script and a complete lack of directing skill.  Basically, they took the storyline which we all know and tried to create special effects around it and use a lot of the lines from the previous films as comedic gestures.  Incredible mistake.  Using phrases like "I'll be back" and "Come with me if you want to live", completely out of context, was excruciating and embarrasing to watch. No imagination whatsoever on the directing or writing.  Although they had some really good actors in the film, the lack of a proficient director and a decent script gave them very little to work with and their performances ended up being very soap-opera'ish.  How Christian Bale got caught up in this mess is beyond me.  Although, I'm sure he got a decent paycheck for it.  I hope the next installment is put in the hands of a proper director who can infuse vision, uniqueness, direction and storyline into the project. In my opinion, give this one a miss.  It will only disappoint.
 Not impressed...  clearly the only motivation behind this movie was to make a buck off the popularity of the first three Terminator movies...  by 15 minutes in I was waiting for it to be over.  About the most memorable thing for me about this movie was all the growling and yelling by Christian Bale (John Connor).  Seems all he did was scream the whole time.  The twist w/ Marcus Wright and his thread through the film was semi-interesting, but not enough so to save the picture overall.  There were some intense action scenes to thrill the 11 and 12 year old boys that were watching, but beyond that I found this to be a huge letdown.
 This is one of those movies where you watch half of it hoping it will get better, but it never does. As the time progresses, your hope of the filmmakers salvaging the project or building up to something really great fades away, and you're left with an ending that was obviously changed at the last minute and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie (not that the original ending could have been much better). I don't know how you can pour so much money and talent into a film like this and have this be the product. It's a stunning failure when you think about it. The special effects are great and there is a lot of action, and you can tell they even TRIED to put some depth into the story, but even these solid ingredients somehow turn bitter when thrown together the way they are in this movie. Perhaps the movie's worst offense is the dialogue. The very first scene sets the bar for the film so low that you wouldn't think it could possibly get any worse, but apparently the director loves a challenge and he found a way. By the end of the movie you won't care if all the characters die, in fact, you might even wish they did.
 I agree with everyone else here.  I call this an EPIC fail!  The sad part is, I own a PS3 and STILL won't buy this in protest!  I find it very offensive that only Blu Ray customers get the Director's Cut.
 This is the worst terminator movie. How anyone can like it is beyond me 1-3 were good this one was utter crap.
 This disappointing mega-music video version of Mad Max is one long romp through ruins. Confusing and disjointed, frequently frustratingly illogical, it comes out boring, even with all the well-done CGI mayhem. Said mayhem is non-stop, becoming a mindless blur of disjointed human and robot body parts flying nowhere.  After the first two in the series, this one is even more of a disappointment, fans should see  this as a continuation of T3; motivated by simply aiming to exploit the Terminator name. At least Amazon had the consideration of dropping the price to $9.99. Small consolation.
 Agree with other reviewers.  Warner pulled this same stunt with Trick r' Treat (only putting bonus features on the Blu disc).  I decided not to buy this dvd because of this.  There's no reason at all that the unrated version should not be available on DVD.  I understand that DVD cannot match the picture quality or sound that Blu provides, however, DVDs have always been able to support audio commentaries and bonus featurettes and to not put them on the DVD and still charge the same prices is ridiculous.  With all the firmware problems on Blu and the fact that my TV does not support HDMI (and I'm not replacing the TV until it breaks).  The more that studio pull this garbage the less likely I will ever convert to Blu.  In fact, I now hope the Blu format fails in favor of digital downloads for HD (with DVD still being available of course).  Very, very stupid Warner.
 I kept waiting for the movie to get going with suspense but it never did.  What a waste of time and money.
 Please, James Cameron, buy back the rights to Terminator (I hear Halcyon could use the money) and save us all from a continuing slew of mediocre "sequels and a poorly executed, woefully under-budgeted, and ultimately canceled TV show (T3, this film, and TSCC).  The only good that's come out of the never ending milking of the franchise is the intriguing protector Terminator character of Cameron Phillips (portrayed by Summer Glau) from TV's The Sarah Connor Chronicles, who is smitten with one baffled and equally smitten John Connor (star-crossed lovers, anyone?).  That's it... end of story.  Don't get me started on Christian Bale's one-note embodiment of an older John Connor, or the cringe-worthy effort by Nick Stahl in T3, or the equally flat performance of Kristanna Loken as the TX, or the bland Marcus Wright hybrid played by Sam "I look bored with my job Worthington in Salvation.  If James Cameron or someone of equal vision and skill could make an entertaining, intelligent, and timely sci-fi/action/adventure epic around a 20-something Cameron (again played by Summer) and a 20-something John Connor and make it an official T3 (ignoring Rise of the Machines and Salvation completely) I'd give this theoretical sequel a chance.  Heck, I'd even love Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick and even Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn to come back for more fun (you have time travel and alternate time lines, JD being pushed back even farther into the future, and a non-Cyberdyne Skynet-like entity evolving differently this time around, at your disposal, so anything is possible... even if the original cast is showing its age-- like us all).  Get the band back together!  Until then... stick with watching the classics The Terminator and T2
 If all you care about in a movie is one action sequence after another, hardly any dialog, zero character development, and no story.... this is defiantly the movie for you. This movie makes T3 look like a classic and the TV show Emmy worthy.
 This is not acceptable. Why am I not in this movie. You cannot self terminate, but you will all be terminated.

 Okay so after ordering this item I googled this company (InetVideo) that was sending it to me and I found that these guys are from Canada. I felt jipped because I thought I was ordering from New York or from the East Coast. It's been a while since I received this item so I am writing this review a bit late. All I can remember was that they took foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrrr to ship the item, and then when I opened the package that looked like it was supposed to be for shipping animal products 'cause it said something about animal product packaging. This envelope had no bubble wrap or anything to protect my movie. The movie itself is great and I loved it but the case for the DVD is not like the Terminator 3 DVD that I purchased within the same week off Amazon. This thing is flimsy and I was extremely aggravated. Like you get what you pay for but there are items that you pay like $0.01 for and shipping is $2.98 and the product is great! Honestly stay away. Go get the DVD from another company because InetVideo SUCKS! I don't like writing bad reviews but these guys deserved it. I spent $7.81 and got the movie late, risked the possibility of damage to the DVD due to the carelessness of the company to package it with consideration and I have to go buy a new DVD case because it's weak and I don't want anything to happen to the DVD. Seriously, go spend your $7.00 on a burger from In and Out or something. Don't give them your money.
 Totally unorginal film!  Don't bother with this tripe, I would write more but is impossible to make this movie any worse than it is!!!!!
 If you want to watch a cartoon, buy "Snowhite and the Seven Dwarfs or some other Disney animated feature.  Or if you want to wander through a game landscape and shoot at robot spiders and flying machines, buy the "Terminator
 I can't review this transaction because I never got the movie.  I thought that maybe things were backlogged around Christmas, but it's February...and still no movie.
 - The special effects are not as exciting as Terminator 2.  - There's no suspense in this movie. Terminator 2 is suspenseful from the beginning till the end.  - There are a lot of actions but they're not engaging as those of Terminator 2 either.  - It was supposed to be touching at the end when someone scarified to give his heart to another person but I was not moved. I don't know it's because of bad directing or acting. It might be both.
 the plot is one of THE worst ever. this is more of a side story, not a direct sequel. not how I thought the series was going to continue at all.  also instead of making things flow smoothly continuity-wise ,they just take bits and pieces from the original and its sequel and threw them in here. you'll catch them if you're a fan.. cringe worthy stuff.  I thought I was FINALLY going to see John running in the dark fighting TONS of Terminators, like those flashbacks have shown us,but NO. There were maybe like 10 Terminator bots in the whole movie. and not even at the same time.  Don't even get me started on that new Terminator kid. How did he survive a NUKE blast? he came out of that whole in mint condition. that whole heart exchange thing..... RIDICULOUS !!! haha. why was that female pilot so dumb? she swore to fight Terminators but she fell in love with this one in 5 minutes. how can they give Bale such little screen time??? they never heard of Dark Knight?  and the computer graphics?? SO SOOOO BAD.  I'm so glad the movie rights are going to be sold off. hopefully another studio will wait for the right director and script. its a known fact the producers of this movie just wanted to make a quick cash with a cheesy movie. and it shows. this movie has no soul.  if you have time, Wiki what their plans were for their sequels. TRULY AWFUL STUFF !!!!
 Boy, I was looking forward to this movie. More Terminator stuff, getting down and dirty with SkyNet, more background on Judgement Day, and Christian Bale to top it all off. Well, I just now finished watching it and am writing this while it's still fresh. Lousy acting. Sub-par special effects if you can believe that of a Terminator movie. Shallow story line. Really poor ending that essentially tries to necessitate another movie. Nothing is resolved. You get no sense of satisfaction. It's a hollow feeling right now. Not worth the rental price, all in all. Hard to believe, really. So typical lately of sci-fi movies, no matter what the budget or who the stars are. Maybe District 9 will be good. I hope so.
 You put a director who doesn't know how to handle the mythology correctly and allows the primary actor to direct from behind his back. His even mentioned that there was over FORTY minutes cut from the movie!  I find it hilarious that the "Director's Cut" only adds in a pathetic THREE minutes into the movie, what happened to the other Thirty-Seven minutes? You know why its a "R" rated release now? Inside those three minutes, you will see a actors.. wait for it... Breast!  Instant Rate R!.....  I didn't like it when I watched it in the theaters. Something there that seemed to nag at me when I walked out at the ending, and I certainly don't like it even more when I found out what was happening behind the scenes to bloat this movie into the 200 Million dollar turkey it turned into! James Cameron spent close to 120 million ('80s/'90s bucks!) to make T2 -which was an Rated R movie no less!- and made a summer blockbuster. Mgee-whiz dumped something equivalent and laid a rotten egg because he couldn't control an actor.  Typical hollyweird in action.
 Get the Terminator Salvation (Two-Disc Director's Cut + Digital Copy) rated R from Amazon.ca  (Amazon Canada)  Product Details Actors
 Compradores do Brasil, cuidado, este blu-ray n� possui legendas em portugu�. Beware custumers from brazil, there's no portuguese subtitles on this blu-ray.
 I was told that I would get the 3-disc set and I got the 2-disc set.  I already opened and had to fight to get a correction.  The customer service was very painful and they are now sending me a new copy allegedly with all 3 discs. I do not have faith that I will get the right copy.  Their is a blog on one of the blu-ray sites that the have been sending both copies probally b/c they ran out and just want to full orders and hope people don't complain.  Don't they know that blu owners take pride in what they purchase.  I like the digital copies for traveling with my IPOD.  This was a key reason with the low cost compared to the box stores....  This is what was advertised
 Hello people, I suggest not buying this movie until the DVD is similar to the Blu-ray!
 Simply horrible.  The acting, dialogue, directing.  Even the CGI wasn't that good.  Steaming Pile of....
 This is by far the worst Terminator Movie ever.None of the action of previous movies.No major fight scenes like in the first movie between the robots and humans Lots of talking and no action.If you liked the action in the 3rd one (a lot of people obviously did not by what I have been reading for other reviews) then stay away from this one. I never fall asleep in movies but I begged for a pillow.lOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKED THIS ONE BUT ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE I got your back!!!!!
 T4 isn't as good as the 1st.  I had a movie ticket to use, & Paramount wasn't showing Star Trek that night. It was OK.  I rate it Z4, as in ZZZZ.
 I ordered this movie about 10 days before Christmas as a Christmas present and it never arrived.  I'm still waiting for some kind of word, even from Amazon.  Still nothing even after contacting twice via email. I'm surprised Amazon even lets this kind company on their web site. Isn't collecting money under false pretenses illegal?  Thanks Amazon.
 All these glowing reviews for this one are obviously planted. This movie was absolutely TERRIBLE - BEYOND being a huge let down. A Terminator Film with this star power cast should be great, no? It is not. McG (director of Charlie's Angels, creator of The O.C. and Pussycat Dolls, to name a few) can not seem to be able to get a decent performance from his actors in this one (big surprise). The film is a watered-down mess - also a PG-13 - with NO on-screen deaths, and 1 death (off-screen) in the entire film. It's poorly edited, and VERY poorly written as well (writers of Catwoman did this one) - this movie was marketed towards kids, but it backfired and the kiddies didn't care. This film was so poorly received it even sent the company that made it, in it's first film, into Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Rent it before you buy it, because you're going to be disappointed and likely agree with me, just like most of the world. By the way - this "directors cut" is only THREE MINUTES LONGER than the theatrical version (NOT 40+ minutes, which was promised by the liar McG) - don't waste your money on this terrible, terrible film - if you must watch it, rent it first. This movie is so awful, I'd say even "Battlefield Earth" is better.
 This film was atrociously bad.  I wouldn't watch it again if it was running free on network TV, much less buy a copy of it.  It was pathetic in all aspects...
 Bought this movie as a Christmas present at a great price.  Saving on each present means more presents for the folks on my list.  Thank you Amazon for helping me out.
 Terminator movies should have stopped after the amazing T2 movie directed by James Cameron. Terminator Salvation is by far the worst Terminator movie out of all 4. It really makes T3 look like a masterpeice, eventhough I did not likt Terminator 3 that much. Christian Bale does not fit as John Connor at all. I can't believe from what I heared that he will be in 2 more Terminator Films. LET THE TERMINATOR MOVIES GO TO REST. IT IS LOSING ITS PLACE IN THE GREAT SCI FI MOVIE LIST.
 Terminator 4 is a disgrace to the Terminator series. The movie does not focus on the war that fans were expected to see. They do explain how John Connor becomes a Leader and he does not show any qualifications as a leader. The whole story focuses on a stupid guy who is considered to be a decommissioned Terminator. Near the end they have this guy talking with a jumbo computer wich is so lame and reminds me of the computer system from "I-Robot". The Kyle Reese Character is also too young and is extremly wimpy!!! Come on, John Connor is going to send this little guy to go back in the past and do it with his mom? They don't even expain how they send him back through a portal or whatever. Man this movie is totally awful!
 This was the first Blue Ray disc that I bought and I have to say the Terminator Salvation movie was so poorly mastered that I could not tell the difference between this "HD" blue ray film and an old regular DVD quality film on my HD tv. Even broadcast looks better on my TV...Story was mediocre, and special effects were OK ...would have been better if this was a REAL HD movie instead of this crap full of unprocessed picture noise.
 I WAS EXPECTING A DETAIL STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION BUT INSTEAD I GOT THE DIRECTOR OF THIS VIDEO TALKING AND TALKING IN THE SCREEN FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THE VIDEO
 I read the review where someone said this movie is full frame, so I referenced this movie on dvdplanet.com. Sure enough, it says it's full frame!!  Unforgiveable !! I think this is 1 of the best movies ever. Who is the bird brained gremmie responsible for sabotaging this dvd ?  Grrrrrrr.  I was going to buy this dvd, but now I will just record from my ES II laserdisc onto a dvd.
 it only had a hint or a flavor of the book. I actually read the book which is really good if you like freaking yourself out. The movie was nothing like it. The movie was just one of those weird 80s things
 It truly mystifies me how there could possibly be any good review of this film. I read the book, became engrossed in it for days, and enjoyed it immensely. It kept me thinking for a full year afterwards. If you've had a similar experience with the book, be prepared for absolute and total disappointment with the film. It will entirely pollute that part of your mind that the book developes so delicately and will leave you feeling deeply frustrated and disappointed. Worse still though, if you see the film before reading the book, you will be driven from the subject entirely, too repulsed to give the book a chance, not to mention the topic in general. The 'visitors' themselves represent a new low in film effects, and appear to be, at best, discount inflatable puppets motivated by discarded animatronics. In total, I feel an urgent sense that this film does a terrible disservice to Whitley Streiber, shifting the story of his experience from a place of thoughtful contemplation into the realm of the comically yet absolutely disregardable. Trust me, stay away, unless you enjoy pressing the fastforward button on your remote with desperate intensity.
 This was a complete waste.  Walken is good, but God what a waste!  I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me.  But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything.  He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion.  This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke.  Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it.  After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot.  But I'm still human.  I still have opinions.  And my opinion of this is, yuck!
 I don't own any of these, although they are all great flicks.  Unfortunately, this collection isn't a great deal compared to buying them  individually. It doesn't offer any substance beyond the individual DVDs,  only the convenience of buying them all at once.  My suggestion would be  to mix and match your own Arnie favorites rather than buying this  collection. This collection leaves out the Terminator series, the Conans,  Raw Deal, et al.
 Great character actors Michael Rooker and Blanche Baker headline this low budget shocker about a strange creature lurking beneath icy waters. While it's good to see these seasoned vets, I couldn't help but wish they had a better film to support their talents. While Rooker makes the most of his role as a father and husband pushed to defend his family, Baker seems oddly strained and robotic. But performances aside, there is little in "Hypothermia" to excite movie-goers. You've seen so many variations of this story (back to the Creature From The Black Lagoon), "Hypothermia" really needed to bring something new or interesting to the discussion. And it really doesn't. The plot, such as it is, seemed stretched even with a scant 73 minute running time. The screenplay forces characters to consistently make the most idiotic choices to protract the story to its bloody conclusion. For example, after battling the underwater monster through several deaths, one character decides to lay down right next to a fishing hole for a rest. Genius, huh? I know that's what I'd do! You'd have to be as lame-brained as the characters not to foresee the result of this poor decision.  "Hypothermia" is, in the most classic sense, a throw-back to the cheapie monster movies of the fifties. Wait until you get a look at the murderous creature in question. It's a guy in a poorly fitting SCUBA suit and a bad mask. Far more silly than horrifying, this is a movie that would definitely have benefited by leaving the menacing creature largely unseen. But that's not the choice the makers went with, the creature is front and center and elicits a few more laughs than screams. Rooker and his family have a house on the shores of an icy lake. He, his wife, his son, and his son's girlfriend wander out for a day of ice fishing. A couple of clowns show up to share the ice with them. The father is so over-the-top, he seems to be impersonating Danny McBride at his most outrageous. When encountered with the dangerous beast, they eschew all logical choices to serve themselves up as fish food. It's all so awkward and clunky and familiar, there's not much fun to be had.  Maybe that's my primary problem with "Hypothermia." It takes itself so darn seriously. A little camp or humor would have lightened things up immeasurably. I love bad movie monster mayhem more than most. But "Hypothermia" wants to play as a straight-up shocker. But without genuine thrills or originality, it falls short of its goals. I loved the ridiculous creature! In a humorous spoof, it would have been an outrageously successful creation. But is it scary? Don't make me answer that. Enacting every cliche that you've come to expect, "Hypothermia" simply doesn't serve up satisfying drama or tension. The 73 minutes felt easily twice as long, especially when their cozy house is just a few paces away from the deadly mayhem. A silly and unoriginal misfire. KGHarris, 9/12.
 This is a heavily abridged version of Peter Brook's wonderful film.  About 1/2 the film has been cut from this version.  I owned the VCR version of this movie which is 325 minutes long.  I had assumed this was a long-awaited reprint of an out-of-print classic.  Instead, this is a HEAVILY abridged (170-minute) version of the show.  I bought this as a birthday present for my husband, after five minutes of watching painful cut after painful cut, we had to turn the film off.  I will be returning it ASAP.  I have NO IDEA why the studio did this.  Amazon.com should mark this as an ABRIDGED VERSION.  I can only hope that the studio comes to their senses and released a version of the DVD that is the full 325 minutes, because the VCR tapes I bought 14 years ago are wearing out...
 I have been eagerly awaiting Peter Brooks' The Mahabharata on DVD, and today it arrived.  How disappointed I was to find this version is a little over half as long as the one shown on the BBC and PBS.  I have not watched this version yet, but I cannot believe it will be anything but a slice-and-dice version of the epic tale that I came to love in its television miniseries form and later on laserdisc.  So a warning to everyone
 This is a disappointing, sliced and diced version of the long epic shown on public television many years ago.  The cuts change the storyline and make it difficult to follow, especially in reference to the amazing 5+ hour original.  Buyer beware!  This is not the original, full length version.
 I was disappointed when this version came out that people were being negative about it without even purchasing it. I didn't heed their warning and purchased it anyway.  We live in a great age. We can get complete seasons of television shows. We can get movies with hours of behind the scene footage that enhance the experience. With all of these great things, why would a company abridge a great work like this? The six hour version was already abridged from the nine hour play. The nine hour play was abridged from a 5000 page book.  I tried to watch this version but I felt like I was seeing a flashback episode of a TV series.  We all have been awaiting a re-release of the six hour version. This is an insult to a great work.
 Dammit - I wish I had read the reviews more carefully - this is so badly abridged that if you don't know the story already it is very difficult to follow. I have wasted my money on this, and will now have to buy the full version.
 I didn't realize how good 'Song of Norway' was until I watched this film, which is almost as bad as Gilliam's 'Jabberwocky'.  Peter Brook, like Terry Gilliam, is one of the great charlatans of our time.  Each man is a self-important destroyer of good literature.  Whatever Gilliam touches he turns into boring uncleanness.  Whatever Brook touches he turns into a model of his own ininteresting self.  There is neither health nor beauty in Brook's 'Mahabharata'.  If you want to watch a proper 'Mahabarata', get the Chopra version.  Brook's 'international' version is squalid, boring, and all wrong.  It will be enjoyed only by the illiterate and the perverse.  Let me say something in passing.  The RSC has been for at least three decades an example of all that is bad in the modern arts world.  When will British critics stop treating it as a divine manifestation?  We British have suffered horribly at the hands of our home-grown 'talents' since the 1960s.  Some day we'll get a healthy-minded director who will make faithful films of the John Buchan novels.  Many of us are fed up with directors whose minds are unclean and utterly dull.  The duty of a film-maker is to enchant, to entertain
 In reading the positive reviews of the movie, I was wondering if one needed to take some kind of exotic drugs to write them, and then I wondered wouldn't it be easier just to take the drugs and forget the movie?  Honestly, this one of the worst films I have ever seen since "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and the "Freddy Got Fingered." The production values were poor to say the least. It was hard to identify the the characters and their motivations because no one stands out. Most of the characters were pretty uninteresting or strange, i.e., the woman who gave birth to a bowling ball for example. [Seriously, it is in there. I'm not making it up.] I could not figure out the lineages of the families because they were a pretty mixed group. There was even a Kung Fu master in the film and that part was a bit like Kung Fu meets the Sons of Hercules. Which begs the question, if you are going to have a Kung Fu master why not attack helicopters and rocket grenades, too? Could any film be worse?  No, actually -- this is pretty bad.  It is like watching a bad Star Trek movie if you aren't a fan of Star Trek or familiar with the myth or back-story. One point the woman's future husband is blind so she chooses to wear a blindfold for the rest of her life. What that accomplishes I don't know but there it is.  If you like really bad gladiator movies, this could be your film. Yikes!
 I read on internet about this western version of Mahabharata and was curious to watch how Peter Brook captured it with his western mindset. After watching the movie on DVD which I bought, I was shocked and repented for buying it in first place. It was completely un-artistic and several incidents depicted in the movie are incorrect and the characters barring Draupadi  are hardly any reflection of the characters that Indians understand. Perhaps it is more apt to say that an average indian without knowledge of this movie wouldn't have guessed that he/she was watching Mahabharata. I am sure it's offensive to Hindu's faith, I think Mr.Brook should have limited his ambitions to produce simple stories rather than attempting to screen the greatest epic on earth with his limited understanding and parochial vision and in the process, reducing it to lower than street side drama. Suffice to say that the dramas played by primary school kids were several cuts above this movie. If I had an option, I would have given negative rating !
 Warning to Moms of young children.  I let my 4 year watch this movie.  She adores it and I did not think I had anything to worry about with it until she started saying "I Hate My Life".  When I asked her where she learned to say that and she said from the Barbie movie.  Sure enough, that's what Barbie says in it.  I am shocked phrases like this were in a Barbie movie and I am very disappointed
 Very disappointed by the preview.  My daughter loves all of the Barbie videos and is now very interested in a video that highlights "sophmore year," and "did he kiss you?!" comments.  Up until now Barbie videos have been based on fantasy play and imaginative play and this new viedo applies to real life situations that are too old for the crowd of girls it has always appealed to.  Lions Gate or Mattel has, in my opinion, missed the mark on this one.  Any parent who buys this Barbie Diaries video for their young daughter is just wishing their youth away.
 My biggest complaint with this Barbie movie is the line from Barbies guy friend expressing excitement at walking in on a "girl hug". Do we really need that kind of suggestive remark in a Barbie movie aimed at girls ages 5 to 12?
 This movie is inappropriate for young children (under 8)for whom the other Barbie Princess movies were the target audience. We received as a gift and I'm sure the giver thought this movie would be in line with the others. It is not due to very inappropriate messages
 My daughter, who just turned 9, bought this movie with her birthday money. I watched it with her and was really taken back. She has loved all the Barbie movies, including some of the more "grown up" ones like the Fashion Fairy Secret. This was OVER the top. The girls were in high school and really didn't set good examples. The lesson learned at the end of the movie was totally overshadowed by the comments and situations throughout the movie. It was completely lost. I just had a conversation with my daughter about how she's starting to think boys are cute, etc. I do not want this to be the model for how she handles liking boys and eventually dating. There is so much drama in it - definitely a mean girls streak - and comments that a 9 yr old don't necessarily need to be repeating. My daughter didn't see any negative influences in the movie, so I'm buying it from her for purchase price and then getting rid of it. If she can't identify the poor examples and how NOT to act, I certainly don't want this to be any influence on her of what's "normal".
 story line
 I bought this because of the good reviews, only to throw it in the trash after the first 5 minutes. I was expecting a great western but got nudity and female mutilation in the first 5 minutes. The trash is where it went and where it belongs. What a disappointment.
 This film had a great story line that was poorly executed. It included what appears to be a real horse being trampled to death, a rape scene and other basic violence. I am sure this would receive an "R" rating from MPAA.  At the beginning of the film, the Chinese girls (who actually are the best part of the entire movie) are inspected for their virginity. This of course has some nudity and other quick uncomfortable shots. The only thing that would have made it more gratuitous would have been a copycat scene from Basic Instinct. Ok I can get past that but clearly I would not let younger family members see this. The one scene I could not believe actually made the final cut is the running of the horses. As masses of horses are running toward the camera on the right you can see a horse turn upside down and get obviously trampled, I am assuming to its death. I was incredulous that a scene like that would be left for viewers. Any director would have to know that would color someone's opinion from then on. Obviously SPCA didn't certify that no animals were hurt during the making of this movie. I am sure the scene where horses fall and are killed showed even less mercy for the animals. I just cringe thinking of how many were injured during the production of this saga.  Other scenes were disjointed. How Ritter knew that that the two men were carring diseases when they tried to cross the trail is beyond me. It would have made a great dropping on the editing floor. The rape scene is another great selection for droppings.  If you are considering buying this, do not expect it to be a family western and do not expect to feel good afterward. This film lacked class and was NOT tastefully done. I got the feeling that only men influenced the production of this and I regret spending the money on a film that made money off of the poor treatment of horses. Instead of being an artfully done feel good western, this saga left me with a sick feeling in the middle of my stomach. At the end of the story, I really didn't care that a scroll of what happend to the characters rolled by. If it was based on a true story, I don't think the real people portrayed would be proud of this version of the true events.  Just beware if you choose this "Western" that you are not getting a classic or even one you will want to watch again.
 Sorry but this movie certainly showed a horrific side of the old west.  Sure there were some noble men and victimized young Chinese girls, but they were way outnumbered by the rotten men and women depicted in the movie.  I do not find very graphic violence, nudity, and rape on the top of my must watch list.  I skipped to the ending on the second disk.
 First, let me say the actors and production crew on BROKEN TRAIL do an admirable job on this film. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE does an outstanding job in bringing this film to the screen. But Canada, was chosen, rather than the USA, for actors, production crew and location. These production companies generate alot of money to the local economy. But the locales of the story are supposed to be Oregon and Wyoming. Why was a foreign country chosen instead? Is this because locations and talent were not available or suitable in Oregon or Wyoming? No. Were it that simple. It's because of greed. Because of taxes and other incentives, many American directors and producers work in Canada because it's cheaper. Duvall, who is "Executive Producer" and director Walter Hill, felt they could do it cheaper and better outside the USA to make more profits and work with the people they've done so on so many other films shot in Canada. How much money do these guys need!!!!? I'm surprised at Duvall as he is so pro-american being a staunch Republican. Wake up everybody. We are losing so much of America including even the western through more "outsourcing" and what Duvall proudly calls " our greatest American heritage".
 Thought I would try an anime to see what I missing out on, wow was this horrible. I think I and everybody else should sample the best of a medium. I get that this isn't in that number, but again wow. The mentality of someone that could enjoy this boggles my mind. I'll try Ninja Scroll and if the story development is as offensive I'm checking out. This makes X-Men 3 seem reasonable.
 First of all, this is a great movie, but, the video quality of the DVD is the worst I've ever seen.  I don't just mean noise (though there is plenty of that too), I mean that in fast action scenes there are severe block artifacts, even some moderate action is afflicted with this.  It looks like they skimped by using a single layer DVD and then reduced the video bitrate to squeeze it into the limited space. When I pay for a movie on DVD, I expect clean video with no noise or artifacts, not somthing that looks like a bootleg internet movie, it's literally so bad that it looks like an AVI that was made from a DVD, not a DVD encoded from the original film. It's hard to believe, but the VHS version in a good player actually looks better than the DVD version.  In addition, there is no japanese language track, and the menues looks amaturish (particularly the  ;hand ; pointer).   While it's a great movie, I simply can't reccomend buying it. It'll only encourage more shoddy transfers like this, rent it instead.
 Horrible presentation really can kill great movies. On one hand, the scenery is beautiful, the fight scenes are neato, and the plot actually makes sense for anime. But on the other hand, the character artists seem to be treading water; it's so obvious that this was animated by the same company who made Ninja Scroll that I literally felt like I was watching the same ensemble cast in different roles. The sound is so badly mixed that the dialogue is barely audible, and the sound effects practically blow out your speakers, not that anyone would want to be able to hear the miserable "voice acting" that makes the first Vampire Hunter D sound like Shakespeare by comparison.  Five minutes into the movie I went back to the menu in search of the audio options to try to fix the huge variance; there are none. Then I went looking for the Japanese language track, hoping that it would at least be better balanced and better acted. That's not available either. An anime DVD with no original Japanese dialogue track??? Out of morbid curiosity, I looked through the "special features" that ARE available; they include a "Making of..." video that is nothing more than footage of the AMERICAN voice actors in studio with an ill-fitting "X-treme" soundtrack, a "Fans' Top 10!" section that just replays "the best" 10 scenes from the movie as selected by some random fan-group (exactly as they appear in the movie, but with a giant number in the corner ranking them from #10 to #1), and the ubiquitous "Merchandise" section.  This honestly has to be the worst production I've ever seen on a DVD. Do yourself a favor and pick up a bare-bones, subtitled, Japanese-language version on ["Amazon auctions" inserted by robot] - I promise you you won't be missing a thing.
 As an a long time anime fan, I was horrified to find out that Urban Vision decided that they would not only skip making subtitles for *ANY* release of this movie (both VHS and DVD versions) but they would also be THROWING AWAY the existing audio and dialogue of the movie.  The translations used in the dubbed version are much worse than the subtitled translations because they try to match up the mouth movements. Even beyond the translation differences, the voice actors really take away from the movie.   This was a horrible thing to do to one of the best anime movies of the year.  The original Japanese movie is exceptional but such horrible voice acting makes it difficult to stomach many scenes, even for this die hard Vampire Hunter D fan.  I will be boycotting all Urban Vision products after this appalling act of ignorance...
 I have no review of the version because I couldn't get past the fact that there is no Japanese audio. With all the things that can be done with DVDs today, it doesn't make any since that this one comes with 1 audio choice. Even for region 1 there isn't even a French audio selection. This seems like a shoddy product. A friend of mine even returned his copy because there is no Japanese selection.
 It is disappointing to find that this DVD doesn't have Japanese dialogue setting.  English voice actors for Anime are [bad].  I always hear similar voice like Goku(Dragon Ball)from all the animes, or either they all scream in the scene.  Can't they afford much better voice actors?
 very good movie - 4 stars! but this us edition only contains the english dub!!! (and got very poor picture quality...)
 (...)  I don't care how much effort they put into drawing those vampire castles, because in the end it's a lot of static, 2 dimensional scrolled images.  There was hardly anything 3D and cinematic about it at all, definitely nothing close to Akira or Ghost in the Shell.  The first third of it was entertaining, but I expected a much darker, more advanced animation style, especially considering how they were supposed to be using state of the art computers for it.  It appears they used the computers simply for speeding up the animation and layering the sprites.  The biggest problem I had with the new D film was the lack of game rules on how the vampires can be killed.  By the end, the same entities keep coming back to life, seemingly at the whim of the film's creators.  Without rules, a film becomes a pointless exercise.  I just wanted someone to die for good and the credits to start rolling.
 If you love the real Doors, stay clear of this miasma.  The Doors, I always thought were the greatest rock band of all time, but this vapid flick, created by a brain-dead Hollywood dodo makes the late, great Jim Morrison and the rest of The Doors look foolish, idiotic and talenless goofballs.  This travesty of a flick basically left me fairly angry. I may just have to re-read (for the third time) No One Here Gets Out Alive, and will surely play some Doors music to get rid of the aftertaste left in this viewer's mouth by the rancid Oliver Stone attempt.
 The best performance in the film was Kyle McLachlan's Ray Manzarek, even though his part was small. Val Kilmer lacks charisma in his portrayal of the late charismatic singer Jim Morrison. How can a man who is perpetually stoned and wrapped up in his own little world be interesting or charismatic? I found Kilmer's Morrison unlikeable and unwatchable. The Stone/Kilmer Morrison has no redeeming qualities - casually and carelessly hurting everyone in his path with his selfish, hedonistic lifestyle. I actually fast-forwarded through quite a bit of this film because every scene was just "more of the same".
 The film is terrible and incorrect from the opening credits to the end or when you press the stop button, which ever comes soonest. There is error after error after error on this film. Oilver Stone ammitted to telling some small lies to expand on bigger truths however he never even started telling the truths. Whatever a director could get wrong he got wrong,Morrison's character, names, dates, events and sequencing. Many so called events never even took place, the burning wardrobe and the turkey dinner for example - pure fiction. You like The Doors or Jim Morrison or you want to learn more about them stay away from this product and look for something else. This product is nothing more than insulting to The Doors and Jim Morrison and the one star option was the lowest rating I could give, personally the one star is being generous.
 Even with star power there is little to like about this film, at least for anyone with any interest in it from the perspective of a historic narrative.  The first time I saw it I was impressed at how well Kilmer did at emulating and looking like Morrison. His singing was even okay, in a way. His performances would have been passable even, if it had been a local college putting it on as a weekend theater event, but to suggest that Kilmer did a passable job at singing Morrison's parts is to admit one has either never listened much to the Doors, has a tin ear, or is already impartial to Kilmer. The film would have been much better with Jim Morrison's own voice whenever possible, and much as I hate lip-synching, that's what Kilmer should have done. I'm sure that it would be very hard to find any professional singers who would be impressed by the singing in this movie.  Any doubters may want to try a little experiment - watch some of the movie tracks, then put on the Doors and listen to how much more effective, natural and musical a singer Morrison was. Better yet, find one of the many available videos of Morrison onstage and see how amateurish the impressionism of Kilmer's performance looks. Now just in case anyone thinks I have a bone to pick with Kilmer; I don't. I simply find the emulation of Morrison to be very poor for a movie with the kind of budget that a maker like Stone would have had available.  That said, I think Kilmer did a much better job on L.A. Woman than any of the other tracks, and wonder if it isn't at least partially because he was focused on the much more relaxed atmosphere of the track, rather than the weird side of Morrison he was instructed throughout to portray.  By all accounts Jim was a strange fellow in many ways, but also anything but one-dimensional, but with Oliver Stone being so one-dimensional himself, it's impossible for him to tell any story as a passive teller. He finds it impossible to stand on the sidelines and let us know what happened. It's much more empowering for him to interject his values and agenda onto every story told, which is so much more disappointing because he tells so many important stories - always with his opinion/agenda as more important than history itself.  They say that fact is stranger than fiction - I also find fact to be more interesting than fiction.  When I read so many positive reviews of the movie itself and Kilmer's performance, it immediately reminds me of the Emperor and all the crowds exclaiming about his stylish new outfit. Maybe I'm only a child, because to me, the Emperor has no clothes.  Anyone who thinks Morrison was nothing but a sick weirdo might want to listen to the Doors a little further, and some evidence of the romantic in him is very easily unveiled by listening to such tracks as Touch Me, Love Her Madly, I Can't See Your Face, Indian Summer and Blue Sunday. The incredibly up-beat and positive atmosphere of Land Ho! from Morrison Hotel is very often surprising to people not completely familiar with the Doors albums in general.  Now go check out some real Doors material!
 dated June 5, 2000, that no one has reviewed this movie from an unbiased standpoint -- Dude, I couldn't care less about Jim Morrison or his   ;doors ;  either way, so, rather unfortunately, I'm merely left with this movie that Oliver Stone dumped, like a pile of rubbish, on an unsuspecting world.  *The Doors*  features pretentious photography, time-lapse photography, jump-cut photography, murky photography, and downright MTV-inspired photography.  Stone even uses a Steadicam at various points, for Pete's sake.  The results are ugly, to be frank.  But forget all that; that's technical stuff, and may be overlooked as long as the subject matter is worth watching.  I'm afraid that Stone failed to make his case, here.  The question before the Court is
 this movie is hogwash. oliver stone blew it with this one.With subject matter as the doors a really good film could have been made. its filled wth inaccurate information ie jim didnt quit film school stone did! the surviving Doors in documentaries state that stone missed the boat, morrison had addictions he also was talented but by the look of this film you would never be able to tell. Val kilmer does look and sound alittle like jim morrison but he never seems to let us want to  care anything about him or his art.the movie is a mixed up mess "IS EVERYBODY IN" Gee i hope not!
 be serious
 Oliver Stone's portrayal of the Doors and Jim Morrison is extreme and in many cases untrue and exaggerated.  He takes the events of the Doors and binds them into cliche rock band problems that never happened.  The UCLA  film by Jim Morrison was never that extreme, and there were a lot more  inaccuracies in the movie.  If you want a true account of the Doors, read  Light My Fire by Ray Manzarek.
 The movie is amazing..Val Kilmer deserved an Oscar for his roles..Maybe the best acting role in the 1990s.  Ok..The DVD 2 disk special edition..You'd expect the movie to be a proper transfer..Heck, the put released it with 2 DVDs..NOPE..  It is in widescreen letterbox 2.35
 Schoolhouse Rock! is supposed to be complete on DVD but Disney has pulled another fast one. They have left out one of the four "Scooter Computer & Mr. Chips" videos. Shame on them! I urge everyone to contact Disney and demand a remastering!
 I was soooo excited to get this home and play it because I grew up listening to these cartoon segments every Saturday morning!  But it bored me.  They just weren't as good as I remembered them, I guess.  I ended up fast forwarding through most of it.  I paused for the classics "I'm only a Bill etc, but I didn't seem to recognize most of them anymore. If you're looking to relive a little childhood, rent it first-  then if you think you can live with it, buy it.  Perhaps you need to check to be sure you recognize more than 1/2 of the titles too.  (I 'thought' I did!) -I personally wish I had my money back.  (My kids even begged me to shut it off!) Just my opinion...hope it helps those of you looking to purchase it.)  1smileycat 
 DVD arrived in a timely manner; however once I inserted the DVD in it would not play.  The DVD made a lot of strange sounds but never showed a picture nor gave a clear sound.  Dissapointed
 I was really looking forward to sharing my favorite memories of Schoolhouse Rock with my two daughters, ages 6 and 4. However, the DVDs I received were marred by encoding problems from the manufacturer. I attempted to replace the disc 2x but was unable to find a copy that could play successfully in DVD  player.
 These disks will not play on a Mac.  At all.  Since my macs are my only DVD players, this makes the set no better than coasters.
 I couldn't get this program to work; I concluded that it is incompatible with Windows XP.
 I don't know who the people are on this interview, even though they are labeled as "entertainer". The Narrator sounds like he is reading a book report that half of it is filler. The few times we see Katy Perry speaking was taken from random TV interviews or was taken from vlogs. Somebody was looking to make a quick buck with a DVD with Katy Perry on the cover.
 This dvd went from the dvd packaging into my dvd player and then directly into the trash (cradle to the grave scenario)...this product should never have been released because it's of zero quality (btw, who the heck are the three twits being interviewed, they seem to have zero relevance to the artist whatsoever)...I took a chance on this knowing it's an unauthorized release, and I got burned big time! Buyer beware, this thing stinks!
 Very poor quality copy - so dark it is impossible to tell what color the horse is.  We live in Carbondale, where this was shot, so ordered it for our cowboy-loving grandson.  What a disappointment!
 Not enough close ups to see how fingering should be. Never shows you how to line up the footer with the rest of the flute. She is much too  nervous. Ernie O
 It's the same DVD as Death By Decibels .. Read those reviews.  The producers put out the same DVD, which BTW has little to do with the band, under several different titles with different covers in order to rip-off the fans of a band the producers have nothing to do with. The cover gives you no clue that the Deftones are not on this DVD.  I also got ripped off by buying the same Muse DVD twice by producers who had nothing to do with the band.  In future I will be reading the review of a music DVD before buying from a music store.  This sort of crap only serves to hurt the bands, the music stores and the music industry in general. As a fan, I feel like I've been ripped off and will get stuff from the Internet for free instead, so ensuring that I don't waste my hard-earned money.  Les.
 La novela no esta entera comienza adelantada y Los capitulos ban cortados no se le entiende no la compren no gasten su dinero
 This is such a great story and when I watched it I got to side 4 and it was SO damaged and scratched that it wouldn't play on any of my DVD players. It was frustrating because all of the other DVD's worked just fine.  Side 3 was also scratched and damaged so badly but for some reason it did play. I wish that I could get a new one without buying it but it's been a while since I purchased it.  I saw it again online and am thinking of buying it again. It's just a shame that I didn't open it right away and watch it so that I could have exchanged it.  I don't remember who the seller is anymore but I wish I did so that I can send them an email asking for a replacement. If you buy this Novela it's great as long as you get good working DVD's.
 I normally don't write reviews regarding movies. I think people should see a flick and decide it's value for themselves. However, I think the movie  ;Manhunter ; is an outstanding movie. Five stars. Buy it! DON'T BUY the Director's Cut. The entire second disk is fuzzy / out of focus. It's really annoying and a waste of your money. The extra included material is not worth the extra money it will cost you!
 I got the new limited edition 2 disc set of Manhunter and I have to say I have never been more disapointed with a DVD in my life.  First of all the first disc that is supposed to be the theatrical cut of the film is not. Several important scenes and patches of dialouge have been removed, and unimportant scenes from the directors cut are added in out of context. And to make matters worse the cuts are made very crudely, sometimes cutting people off in midsentence.  Then there is the director's cut on disc 2. Saddly this version was never remastered from the source print so the picture quality of the whole film is that of a deleted scene i.e. worse than VHS. Not to mention that several scenes appear to be taken from brodcast tv as several lines of profanity are crudely dubbed over. Take my advice if you are a fan of this movie stay away from this poorly produced DVD, as refusing to buy it might be the only way get Anchor Bay to correct this horrible problem.
 This film is the Great Satan of Thomas Harris film adaptations. "Black Sunday was made into a very good film with Bruce Dern and Robert Shaw..."The Silence of the Lambs (of course)...and "Hannibal (while not exactly top-notch) was good, as well. What this atrocity of a film does, however, is take Harris' greatest novel to date ("Red Dragon") and mutilate it as Dr. Lecter might mutilate a psychiatric patient. The screenwriters for this film excised nearly every element which made the novel so intensely brilliant and (by some twisted logic) left in parts of the novel which became irrelevant in the film, due to the changes made.  Why does the character of Reba even EXIST in this film? Her role in the novel was of paramount importance in the closing chapters of "Red Dragon"...in "Manhunter, however, she is all but a throwaway character. My second problem with the film is this...since when is Hannibal Lecter SCOTTISH? That's right, Scottish thespian Brian Cox portrays Lecter with a distinct accent, despite the fact that Harris' works state that Lecter was born in Lithuania in 1938.  A further problem, and certainly the aspect of the film which garners most of my animosity toward it...how can any screenwriter justify reducing Harris' breathtaking finale in "Red Dragon to a trite "good guy vs. bad guy showdown? Some people who actually READ "The Silence of the Lambs may remember the following statement made by Jack Crawford about the condition of Will Graham following his final encounter with Dolarhyde..."Will's face looks like damn Picasso drew him. I think that should say enough. They left in the TIGER, but left out the ending.  All in all, this film is absolute trash, and the most blatant smearing of a great novel it has ever been my misfortune to witness. Luckily, Ted Tally (screenwriter of the film version of "The Silence of the Lambs") is currently working on his own screenplay for the novel. Hopefully, he won't repeat the same mistakes that the "Manhunter screenwriters made, and the new "Dragon film will live up to its source. Bottom line
 Manhunter was a pretty poor film, in my opinion, nowhere even CLOSE to Silence of the Lambs.  Regardless, the DVD is worse.  The cinematography is beautiful, and the scenes are well shot, but the director's cut on DVD is atrocious.  It looks like a 5th generation copy from a TV show, not the crystal-clear picture I'm used to on a DVD.  I'm a director's-cut fanatic, and this is the WORST director's cut I've ever seen (it makes my ?th generation director's cut of Alien look GORGEOUS).  To top it all off, the editing is choppy and uneven, with dialogue and music abruptly ending.  And of course, the horribly-cheesy ending is still just as horribly cheesy.  This is not a direct attack on the film itself, but the DVD production.  I wouldn't pay $5 for this.  Please, please, PLEASE, save your money!  Or get the VHS tape.  Just don't buy this.
 Sorry.The movie just didn't do it or me. I read the book first and it was quite good. In fact, a few friends and I joined together last year for what we called,  ;The Thomas Harris Reading Project, 2000 ;...sort of in preparation for the release of  ;Hannibal ; this year. In that pursuit, we researched and found VHS issues of the Manhunter movie and we all watched it after we read Red Dragon. We were all very disappointed. The Manhunter movie, did not even make a loose attempt to follow the movie and it was low budget, badly acted, and, as the man in the theater mentioned in one of the other reviews, looked more like a video. What an insult.  Definitely a B-movie. I'm sure it is being trotted out and hyped now since Hannibal is coming out soon, but pls, do not buy this movie expecting anything on the production level of Silence of the Lambs. I also read the book of that last year, as well as watched the Anthony Hopkins movie, and also found THAT book much better than the movie. Having read Hannibal, I don't expect that movie to measure up to the book, either. Let me recommend to true Hannibal Lector fans, the unabridged audiobook of Hannibal. It is beautifully acted, and was thoroughly entertaining.
 So much of the integral parts of the book Red Dragon were completely ignored in this movie rip off, that it is a bitter disappointment.  You don't even see or hear the name Francis Dollarhyde until he kidnaps the  reporter!  There is not nearly enough investment into Dollarhydes psyche,  let alone his motives. The characters that Thomas Harris so vividly brought  to life in his book are shallow replicas in this movie.  If you loved the  book Red Dragon, do yourself a favor and skip this movie.
 For big fans of Manhunter, I would advise you to steer clear ofthis DVD if you plan to own... What has been billed as the  ;Theatrical ; version is in fact a poorly spliced rendition that awkwardly edits two scenes that had been in the theatrical release, including one of the most pivotal scenes, and yet has within it some of most banal footage restored from the cutting room floor. These cuts are both poorly done and have no sense to them, given how they do not represent the theatrical release and destroy the momentum of what had been a finely edited movie. I don't know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but this is the worst hack job I've ever seen trying to pass itself off as product. Whoever was in charge of this at Anchor Bay was an idiot and if I were Michael Mann, I'd be calling my lawyers.  The  ;Director's Cut ; is even worse in that it includes the  ;Un-theatrical ; release AND the so-called  ;Director's Cut ; - a compilation of some interesting and not so interesting out-takes. As a companion to a true theatrical release, this would have been a fascinating addition; BUT here again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what should be a good product. The entire movie that has not been put through video post-production, is smudged and blurry, as if transferred from a VHS tape - and a worn one at that. - Just incredible that anyone could have the audacity to offer this kind of cheapness for hard earned money. I saw this movie when it first came out in the theatre and considered it one of the best of that year; and I rushed to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out.  When the Director's Cut DVD was released by Anchor Bay this year, I'd been on the waiting list - ready to welcome the widescreen THX enhanced version. Being intimately aware of the movie, imagine my disappointment. Don't waste your time. Wait for a better version to come out. As for those folks to want to compare Silence of the Lambs to Manhunter, usually they favor one over the other and their minds are pretty much made up at this point. I'm squarely in the Manhunter camp. For myself, I enjoyed Silence, but I could never take it seriously since I found the portayal of Lector both cartoonishly superhuman and therefore unrealistic and unsuspensful. However, Manhunter's Lector  is a chilling but more realistic portrayal that awes me every time I see it in how one evil genius manages to manipulate events outside of his cell through the simple device of a telephone. This Lector is safely behind steralized bars - and yet still manages to be a forceful presence to tbe reckoned with. I hope every fan and future fan of Manhunter gets to see it the way it first came out, a fine piece of craft that was lean and edgey, and yet which flowed stylishly. Siskel and Ebert rated it one of the best movies ever, years after it came out. But for now, I'll be holding onto my LaserDisc.
 With all the great actors in this film who are absolutely the top, I expected the film to be excellent. To me, it is a film that does not know where it is going. It heads off in too many directions. I was thoroughly disappointed. Maybe I should have read the book first, but Mr. Roth is not a favorite author, he writes as if dialog for textbooks, and soon becomes boring and hard to concentrate on the story.
 WARNING! Don't believe the hype. This movie is boring as HELL! Absolutely nothing happened. Come on, I wasted my time trying to avoid falling asleep hoping that something interesting would happen, or that there will be a major turning point soon. I got NOTHING! Anthony Hopkins is really a black man...PUHLEEZE I THINK NOT! Get real, that was so unrealistic and unbelievable. Maybe, if it were somebody/anybody else besides Anthony Hopkins I could buy that, but not him. What was Nicole Kidman thinking? There is way too much star power in this movie for it to be as bad as it is. I don't know or see what a lot of other viewers saw, but apparently based on the overwhelming response of positive reviews a lot of people like it. I find that shocking, but I guess to each it's own. I've seen my fair share of movies, and I have a pretty open mind, but I didn't like this one at all. Frankly, I have seen some of the worst movies imaginable, but this one, I must say was one of the worst movies I've even witnessed.
 "The Human Stain was recommended to me by a friend from Atlanta Georgia. When I was scanning amazon's web for dvds, I was so happy to see that they had this dvd. When I inserted the dvd in my player, I received a message saying please eject, not for this area. I was so dissappointed,and trying to get credit is like trying to pass a congressional act. I will never order anything through amazon.com again and have advised all my family and friends of my experience.<a href="http
 So you put 4 talented, or I think it's safe to say extremely talented, actors together and what is supposed to happen?? Not this! I'm in shock at the complete dullness of that movie. Don't get me wrong, Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins, in whatever movie they are in, give a great performance, but this could have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Sure, it may have been well shot with nice scenes and good acting, but what ever happened to a little something called a plot? By the end of the movie I was praying for it to be over. I didn't care if any of the actors died because I had no sympathy for any of them except for the african american family. I'd like to know how some of these movies get made these days. The screenplay is one of the most important, if not the most important, aspect of movies and this movie bombed. Could it be any more miscasted? (is that a word) Also, there wasn't one twist. There wasn't one plot point that caught my interest. This movie could have been an amazing thriller but instead it was Hopkinds and Kidman having sex for two hours because... oh wait I don't know why they like each other. This movie could have been amazing, even with the same actors as it had. Kidman's past would be amazing if elaborated, and the whole sex deal between her and Hopkins would have to go. My favorite part of the movie, if you can call it that, is when the psycho crazy guy kills them both. I find this movie an insult to Hollywood and an embarresment to the actor's careers. I'd like to know what the director was thinking. Books are different than movies. Books can keep your interest in different ways than movies can, and I'm sure the novel it was based on was great, but this movie was a dissapointment, and I'm shocked at the five stars that appear on the site. If you want to see Kidman and Hopkins really give a permormance rent Instinct or The Others, not this excuse for a movie. Sorry if I was harsh, but I can't belevie what i just watched!
 What in god's name was Robert Benton thinking? Or Sir Anthony? Or Gary Sinise? Was Ed Harris after the Oscar he was denied last year? This film is a perfect example of a wonderful combination of artists put together & creating a monumental cinematic disaster.. Gary Sinise(narrating here)sounds like he was awakened from a deep sleep, had a microphone shoved in front of him & handed the script to read from. Anthony Hopkins looks like he can't wait for it to be over. I wonder if when he studied acting, he ever thought he'd have to do a scene where he half-heartedly discusses the joys of Viagra. I'm not sure what Nicole Kidman's character was supposed to be...watch her closely..sultry? sexy? femme fatale? I don't think she did either.. This DVD should be free with ANY purchase...Disastrous.....
 Ive seen bad films, but this one takes the cake,,, unfunny, amateurish, boring and stupid actors.  Looks like they wanted to make a bad movie like they used to make  in the 50's....and failed.  Shot in black and white with the gore and cheap sex scence in color.  Even if they were shot in 3d it would not save the film.  Please give me real moviemakers and send these low grade crappy actors/directors into the sunset....  This film makes the Toxic Avenger series look good.......
 This is one of my favorite, don't worry about the content, movies.  I was totally disappointed with the DVD version.  The picture quality was simply awful.  Contrary to what was advertised, the DVD was a cheaply reproduced copy.  I was so disgusted that I trashed the DVD and now look forward to watching Red Dawn on late night televison.  Purchase this movie only from a highly rated vendor.
 This one deserves a place of honor among Great Bad Films. The acting is absolutely wooden, the plot  implausible,  production values and action sequences cheap, all of it bathed in a heady mix of hoary right-wing paranoia and american apple-pie mythology.  If you're a tea-partier you'll probably love it. The rest of us, it might do for drunken late-night amusement.
 Communist troops land in middle america and begin machine-gunning children.  A Russian soldier disarms a corpse and the camera pans to a bumper sticker  ;They will take my gun away when they pry it from my cold dead hand ;.  Get the idea.  This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.
 I can understand the reasoning for making this movie.  The timing of what was going on.  But, please!  Make a movie that makes more sense and logic!  As a former military officer, I'm just beating myself in the head over this absolute piece of trash!  Russian Paramilitary jumping out in the middle of a clear, beautiful day?  In the middle of Colorado?!  Pulleeze!!  It all goes downhill from there!!  The military detection systems wouldn't have been that bad!!  The acting is so bad it's not worth writing about!!  Let's face it, if they wanted to make money off this trash, they've succeeded because it wouldn't have won any awards!  Don't waste your time!!
 OK, so there are these Russians, and they attack the U.S. by parachuting into the interior of the country, whereupon they commence blasting everyone and everything in sight.  Kids in a small mountain town high school are shocked to see camo chutes decending lazily through the morning sky, and then the brutal execution of - oh, pretty much anyone standing around.  I suppose if you're a brain-dead redneck, you might find the story intriguing.  Otherwise, you're in for two hours of "Oh brother! This is one of those nonsensical flicks where the villians are depicted at first as being so incredibly competent they can invade America and come within a hairsbreadth of conquering us, but then, they can't find a bunch of sullen, surly and absolutely moronic children. Even when the kids stoll into town for a visit!  Here's the plot
 Red Dawn is, unfortunately, one of the worst films I have ever seen. It should be checked out only if a prospective viewer happened to be totally anti-American. Observing the totally unrealistic stupidity in which the  characters are portrayed would justify the sacrifice of two hours of one's  life. I couldn't help thinking during most of the picture that the `heroes'  are acting this way because Russkies have cut off their cable. `We gotta  fight for our right to party' is obviously a motto of this trash. Wooden  characters, egregious script, and all of this bathed in new-cold-war hatred  towards any culture that is not synonymous with conception of McDonald's  and gas stations where one can ALWAYS depend on Campbell's Chicken Noodle  soup. Don't take even a minute of this rubbish seriously. This film is  viewable only when the viewer is intoxicated AND has agreed from the very  beginning to perceive this thing as a fable. One has to see a bad movie in  order to be able to appreciate the good things in life. So go ahead, grab a  six-pack and enjoy yourself.
 ... unrelentingly poor. The premise is instantly shot to buggery as we are expected to imagine a large-scale Soviet invasion via the Bering Strait. Then we are given to understand that the fiendish Ivans have pincered Denver with the help of Cuba and Nicaragua. Credibility is as thin on the ground elsewhere in this wreck. All characters, both goodies and the baddies, are caricatures, the acting is comically poor, the political message about as subtle as a kick in the bollocks. I'm as pro-gun as any European can be and a rabid nationalist to boot; you don't have to be a bed-wetting crypto to acknowledge the extreme crappiness of this piece of Eighties high camp. When will the Yanks realise WWIII is not something to be romanticised. I'll stick to 'Threads'.
 This movie is tailor made for all the conspiracy believing militia people out there.  But beyond that it is a bad movie.  The acting is bad.  The script is a joke.  The Direction is "by the book" boring.  Worst of all, the entire movie just goes nowhere.  I never felt anything for any of the characters.  So when they die is like "so what."  Close to the end I was rooting for the Russians.  If your locking to watch a good 80's action movie, go rent Predator or First Blood, don't waist your time on this one.  In nothing else a good example why there are not many right wing conservatives weighting believable scripts in Hollywood.  They Can't!
 No word on earth would describe the stupidity of this movie in a sufficient manner.
 Just like Farenheit 9/11 is a despicable, demagogic movie of the left, so too is Red Dawn on the right.  I will say one good thing about this movie, in contrast to the ultra-boring Farenheit 9/11
 I thought about giving this film an intellectual review, but that would have been a complete waste of time. Watching this film could be compared to listening to a C.W. McCall album with a bad case of nausea or perhaps something scatological. Simply pathetic. The only redeeming role was performed by William Smith, who was the ONLY actor who seemed to exhibit talent, putting Sheen and Swayze to shame as acting professionals. This film would only have value for students who are seriously studying Russian and at that would be applicable to Chapter 22 with Smith's "I Am A Hunter" speech. This film is a good example of how you can't win a game when only one person on the team shows up.
 The chuckleheads on Amazon who think this film is "awesome" are the reason western civilization is in decline. Of course their sins can be forgiven.. if perhaps they are only 18. When Red Dawn came out in 1984 I was 17, thinking of joining the military with my own subscription to Soldier of Fortune. I was gulable and naive and Red Dawn had a real impact on me. It seems bizzare now but for some reason I thought that the possibility of Cuba ganging up with Nicaragua to invade our southern border seemed plausable. Instead of the military I chose to go to college. That November I had just turned 18 and I cast my first vote for Ronald Reagan on the strength of the delusions of Red Dawn. I decided to major in history and political science and it didn't take long until I realized just how misguided and wrongheaded I had been. My advise to the champions of this film is to open a history book and lean about American Foreign Policy or short of that rent the Erroll Morris film "The Fog of War". Like I said it's fine to like this film if you don't know any better but alas it's time to put childish thing away.  PS. this review deals with the political messege of Red Dawn it would take many more paragraphs to lay out the aestetic faults of this dog.
 "Red Dawn" sucks. It's that simple. Unrealistic, comical, horrid acting, horrid script, comical depictions, cliches and stereotypes all come immediately to mind. I won't try to to come up with other adjectives for fear of wasting time. That military minds find this plausible is a scary indictment on our military. That some find this a quality movie with great acting is an indictment on our movie industry, which' thrives on a "give them what they want" mentality. Poor Lea Thompson. She has both this movie and "Howard the Duck" on the 80s section of her resume forever. And don't even get me started on Patrick Swayze, the Ted McGinley of his era. Don't believe the rave reviews posted by dimwits or right wingers who don't know quality film. This movie sucks. It's really that simple. I did my best to warn you to save you some time and money.
 This film is such a joke, a completely dated piece of right wing, jingoistic propaganda.  The 80's was filled with "the Russians are coming!  The Russians are coming!" propaganda.  The MSM, Washington, DC, and Hollywood all made it sound like that dreaded Soviet invasion was going to happen anyday.  Well, as far as I know, the Russians never invaded.  They never dropped the bomb.  We're not all speakin' Russian.  This film was written and directed by John Milius, a filmmaker with a pro militaristic viewpoint.  The film is unintentionally hilarious today, because of its totally unrealistic scenarios.  This film is no different than any propaganda film you would see during wartime.  Well, the Cold War is over, and we won thanks to Ronald Reagan, John Millius, Rambo, Arnold, Rocky IV, and Chuck Norris movies....
 Unless you are interested in the challenges posed by introducing a number of displaced youth who have grown up in an extremely deprived and disjointed society to the United States, this movie will not "do it" for you.  If you take any child (or adult for that matter) out of ANY of the most deprived regions of this world (including some parts of the USA) & transplant them to an environment with modern conveniences and societal norms, they would have the same challenges faced by the Sudanese kids. They don't need to be refugees first.  The most intriguing phenomenon in the entire film is the obvious mistrust and lack of connection between poor African-Americans and poor Africans, beyond the color of their skin.  For the most part, the situation exists between most working-class Africans and the African-Americans with whom they are lumped up with and have to coexist with at work and home (if they live in predominantly black neighborhoods) and is therefore nothing new, unless you are of a different race.
 The acting was bad, the story could have worked if the movie wasn't filled with stupid fillers like one of the characters waiting around for a pay check, another character sitting around in a closet and making a big deal about a narcoleptic janitor.  Much of the movie was filled with stretched out dead moments.  Really, never recorded Tupac lyrics on a roll of toilet paper sitting on a shelf in an office, come on.
 Not worth the money.  No plot.  Just some nonsense. Don't waste your time or money.
 rent it. If u must see it. I should have kept on walking. Loved the actors but this movie just gave them a little paycheck. I couldn't finish this movie at all. I tried then I said why?
 What a disappointment! Writers block supreme! they resurrected every villain, acquaintance, and relative of Clarks. They made him face and defeat every one he ever fought and then killed them off again. So many flashbacks the viewer often lost sight of what was actually going on.  More alternate dimensions, got sent back to the phantom zone, the Luthers, on again off again weddings, and any other trite cliche you can think of. Barely watchable and certainly not worth the price.
 The show worked at its core when Jonathan Kent was still on and you had father and son moments. The dynamic of him with his parents made the show like you'd expect an early start of Clark's life to be. Somehow by season 10, they got wayyyyyy off track! The whole blue blur crap, and Clark looking like the only idiot alien who is afraid to fly... It just got bad.  The finale was pretty pathetic in that you don't see him in the full suit. They just cgi (and bad cgi) him into a crappy costume that you get a glimpse as he helps a plane ala Reeve/Routh from the movies.  EWWW stay away from this one folks and wait for the "Man of Steel" movie starring Henry Cavill.
 This final season I place in the worst season in the ten year history of the series. If I had seen this series on television I would not have purchased the box set.
 I watched Smallville off and on and here of the 10th season being there last.I bought seasons 1-9 and watched them until season 10 started,so I could catch up.Most of the early season so the same way every episode,so you probaly will get tired of watching them,like I did.Someone always gets knocked out and doesn't remember what happened the week before or the book The Art of War gets quoted alot by Lex or Lex's father and the constintly repeating scenes of conflict or make up to break up in one whole episode kinds of things get old.But season 1-9 were very fun and exciting to watched and season 9 was truly amazing with the JSA and all the other specail appearrances throughout.  But on to season 10.A very hard season to follow or want to follow.They clearly made this season for everyone from the original cast to come back to say there final goodbyes.Which was nice,even though most of it just seemed like a flip of a switch and there they are,so if you missed even the smallest parts of the episodes.You would be completely lost and with all the people comming back made alot of the episodes for this season seemed half assed or as if they just stopped caring about the show anymore,for example,an entire episode about a very rare bow that they spend an entire episode on,ends up getting destroyed the last 5 minutes of the show or the hangover episode.  Where everyone has to find out what happened the night before,which that episode was very lame.I also hate that that there was no main villian that has anything to do with the story at all.Just shadows of the actual person or clones or body switches instead of the clear cut villain like Lex or Zod were in the past.Darksied would just send his lackies to do most if not all his dirty work,which made him look like a giant pussy.It was like he had something better to do because it didn't seem like he got very involved in what was going on.  It all comes down to two things.After 10 season of constint focus was on the Clark Kent's character and not Superman,but in later seasons,Clark gets called the blur,which finally starts separating the Clark/Superman "the blur" dynamic alittle.But in season 10 they just seem to cram the full change of Clark being a nerd,who can't do anything and Superman "the blur" doing all the things he can do overnight and no one noticed the huge changed and thought it wouldn't be odd,but all of the other characters must have gotten knocked out and forgotten the past 9 years of there lives.But the last,but most important,the whole flying thing.I honestly thought season 10 was finally the season where he would fly.Not on the very last episode and for a very short time on the last episode.  To me it just seemed like they were giving the middle finger to all the superman fans,I always pictured superman being the strongest and most powerful hero out there,but in recent years in animation as well as live action,he would rather root for the Batmans or Green Arrow characters because for the least powerful characters they seem to fair alot better than Superman,who get controlled by the villian or knocked out or kidnapped or something stupid like that and in live action does extremely well only not do extremely badly later on.
 I used to like watching this series early on, when it had stories in it, before the endless sad futility of the Lana Lang romance wore me out... Thought I'd give this last season a try, see if it all came to anything. And what I found was a travesty. Whole episodes seem to consist of characters pretentiously declaiming abstract profundities like, "In order to live in the present, I need to let go of the past, dad. That means I have to say goodbye to you." It seems as if the whole story is taking place on some level of vapid commentary. They forgot to invent action - actual plotlines - that would convey these trite messages and make them fresh. It's like a clinic in what Henry James said not to do when he advised authors to show, not tell. The finale goes even farther, with Clark realizing that he shouldn't have let go of the past after all, because although his strength comes from Krypton, his heroic traits come from the Kent family farm. Only this message isn't dramatized -- nothing happens that would make the viewer realize it as lived truth -- instead it is rammed down our throats in the form of...words. We don't need characters saying things like,"A hero can only be as strong as his enemies, so that's why I, Lex Luthor, am here." That is supposed to be the job of commentators and critics, who unearth such insights from a good story. But these modern protagonists insist on bloviating about their own significance. The rest of the story is either really bad science fiction or really generic soap opera, and the performances are the same. Some talented actors are dragged down by the lines they must speak. The splendid Erica Durance is turned into a sappy one-dimensional poster girl for faithfulness and fairy tale marriage; the mischievous Alison Mack barely rises above her Spielberg-like bedtime story scene; and it's hard to tell if Tom Welling can act, but he comes off as irretrievably stiff and not too bright, and doesn't look facially anything like any Superman we've ever seen in comics. If you like watching people make speeches about the deep meaning of life instead of embodying it, you'll love Smallville Season 10. All moral, no story.
 It's official, Smallville butchered Superman. The series stuck to its original goal of preventing Clark from becoming the Man of Steel for as long as possible. And when he finally does change, the scene are the worst Superman scenes to be filmed. There's only two maybe three shots of Tom Welling in the suit and the rest of the time Superman is shown in a far away shot done with incredibly poor computer animation. The series decided to do its own version of Superman saving an airplane and its absolutely pathetic. The film Superman Returns has a far superior scene and it even won several awards for it. But that's because that film was actually done by Superman fans and by people who had actually read the comics. Smallville clearly isn't done by Superman fans and they maybe have read about ten issues, and obviously hated them. Hence the reason why Smallville stays away from Superman for so long and doesn't even give the characters their original names. The Blur? Velocity? What stupid names to give Superman and The Flash. Now what really is awful about the finale is how it ends. Lex is barely in it, and maybe the actor had two, three days of filming. (but more than likely just one.) And Clark doesn't even fight Lex or Darkside. I was at least expecting a fight scene between the those two once Clark became Superman, but no he just moves the fire ball away in the last ten minutes of an hour and half show. The whole episode is horrible and boring because most of it is Clark and Lois complaining about getting married and complaining about their futures. Boring! Now if people really want to see a good version of Superman, check out the animated films from DC Animated Warner Studios. Those films are marvelous, stay true to the comics, get PG-13 ratings because of all the action, and they show why cartoons are the best way to deliver comic books as movies. Live action films are just horrid, cartoons, that's where it's at.
 After not watching smallville for a while I decided it was time to start up again. Needless to say I was disappointed. Lois is some undercover superhero that goes from a chauffer to a stripper and amazingly (not!) she knew her way around a club she had NEVER been to, stole a costume, managed to find a wig and ta da she was seducing the bad guy. They made the Lois character with too big of a head, Clark is too much a wimp to amount to much. Smallville has gone way down with the addition of Lois and her character.  I am curious if this will survive after season 10....
 My 4 year old boy had many questions while watching this DVD.  The most troublesome of all was how did Thomas get off the raft and onto land?  Did the tracks come right up to the water?  Did the Logging Locos have drivers, signal men, and men to tend to their fires and made sure they had coal?  I think the new showrunners, as someone else has called them here, are underestimating the intelligence of their audience and this is a sad turn of events.  The original Thomas was smart and stayed true to how a railway actually worked.  This new Thomas just throws that out the window.  One thing I always loved about Thomas was there was never a bad or inherently evil character.  Sure some of the Engines would say rude or mean things (James, Gordon)but in the end they always learned their lesson and were apologetic.  At the end of the credits Diesel 10 ominously appears from behind a mountain and speaks some scary words with a cackle.  Since he was not featured at all in this movie this is obviously a hook for a future DVD.  Diesel 10 has been part of the Thomas cast for some time and he has always been an intimidating character, yes.  But he was never scary or seen as evil as they are trying to portray him now.  I am not pleased with this new direction for Thomas and his friends.  This movie is basically just a big commercial for the Trackmaster Set which will cost you $50. or the Take & Play set for the Xmas season.  The worst part is that there is zero attempt to hide the fact that this is just a movie made to hawk toys.  Character development is nonexistent and the dialogue is super simple.  One of the characters just says the same thing over and over.  "That's right". My kids are bored with it already.  Note to the producers and directors of The new Thomas movies
 As a parent I very much enjoy watching Thomas shows and movies.  I rather like trains and Thomas is the standard for child train movies.  However this movie is a dramatic deviation and has a thoughtless story line decorated with absurdity.  In short, Thomas accidentally drifts off to a island five miles directly offshore of Brendam docks.  Despite the FIVE MILE undersea train tunnel linking Sodor to Misty island and the close proximity to shore, none have seen Misty island. Thomas meets new trains on misty island (Dash, Bash and Ferdinand)who were sent to exile on the island for being not really useful and together they work hard to exploit an endangered tree to build a rescue station. Everything works out in the end but they waste valuable story time by logistical reasons of finding some of the people who were out finding Thomas before he rescued himself (if that makes sense).  It should have at least made sense to the writers that this was a horrible story.  Also, introduced in this story is the Captain (a boat) who is the only one who has an English accent as all sea-going people have English accents.  Finally, Hit entertainment, who puts together Thomas movies, makes getting to the actually movie another logistical challenge by removing function of the "menu" button thus bypassing previews is only achievable through pressing the "skip" button a million times.  I though i was paying for the movie not Hit entertainments free reign of smothering my child with previews of their other products.
 This show's had its ups and downs over the years, and after <a href="http
 If you are looking to painfully entertain your children while promoting the latest and upcoming Hit Entertainment Thomas and Friends toys for Christmas, then this film is for you!  A true waste of time for anyone looking to share moral and ethics lessons with their favorite blue engine.  The story is as deep as a mud puddle.  I'd go as far to say it not only insults the Awdry/Thomas legacy, but our kids intelligence as well!  Hero of the Rails was bad enough, but Hit has slumped to a new Low with this pitiful outing.  It makes me glad I spent so much years back on Thomas DVD's for our first round of kids, now the little ones can enjoy the "better stories of Sodor, and this garbage can be forgotten on the shelf.  The one star is for Ferdinand, the 3-Truck Climax locomotive, one of our favorite prototypes.  Pass on this DVD, you'll be glad you did-for the kids sake...  and while I have you.  Who comes up with these titles? New Thomas Christmas film-Thomas & Friends
 Misty Island Rescue is terrible.  It's amazing how absurd this series has become since the UK days, and this is the worst of all of it.  The writing is awful, the message is ludicrous, and even my 4-year old is sensitive to the contrived story and nonsensical plot contrivances.  This is basically a 90-minute toy commercial written by people who have never seen a train before, and don't seem to know how they work or what they are for.  Roger Corman movies are far more realistic and interesting.  Instead of buying this, get a collection of old episodes before the CGI.
 This DVD stopped right in the middle, which was very upsetting to a 4 year old.  It would not forward to restart a little later or anything.  It was done.  I bought him another and threw this one out.  This was my the only disappointing experience we've ever had with an Amazon order.
 I really hope the people in charge of making Thomas read these reviews.  My 3 yr old fell in love with this show over a year ago.  Even he prefers the old model "live action" version.  The computerized crap has lost the magic it used to have.  BRING BACK THE OLD THOMAS!!!
 I remember my pre teen years watching this show. Loved it. This is VERY MISLEADING INDEED! I should have read ALL of the customer reviews before buying. It's not a complete series. It's the last seven episodes. I wasted good money to get Screwed over. Lesson Learned. Luckily I purchased used so it wasn't a complete loss. Even if you wanna go search for the OVA 1 and 2 of Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki, don't. Tenchi Universe is much better and funnier. Go that route instead.
 Silly annoying over-the-top acting!...Comedy that's all to predictable being the same as most comedy Bollywood movies, following the same formula of comedy but this time just way to silly. Katrenia does her usual same wooden acting as in all her other films - look sexy, smile, dance - That's it!  If it wasn't for the soundtrack this film would have got 0! Stupid plots, predictable characters, silly unfunny jokes, no acting skills. Avoid!
 I am a generous critic. I like almost like something about a movie and review it generously.  This movie is ridiculous. I enjoy the soundtrack. You should just keep listening it it.  Acting is in one word
 I like Bollys. A LOT! I purchase and see many of them. Music and humor is light as air and an excellent palate cleasner, after the usual "there been a murder" "let's blow something up" type of films that currently pass for cinema. Kiiing is just plain out of the way I need to barf stuff. Horrible, terrible, rotten, no good and also a stinkeroo. Almost as bad as Marigold. Another alleged fun flic where I hated EVERYONE in it, regardless of their roles.
 I have to begin by confessing that Spielberg movies, with the exception of Empire of the Sun, have always bored me. If ever a director typified the standard lazy Hollywood churn-out-the-schlock mentality it's Spielberg. This movie - which I was asked to watch by a friend who likes sci-fi - actually hits a low spot because pretty much every aspect is flat. The camera work is tiresome and unimaginative, the script could have been written by a write-a-cliche computer program, the acting is one-dimensional, there is no plot, and the special effects are frankly unintentionally funny but always boring and telegraphed hours in advance. Likewise the soundtrack is... well, let's just say, this movie definitely would be better with the volume set to zero.  In addition to being a tiresome hack job in which everyone dials in their contribution from long-distance, it's a sci-fi movie with no science and no fiction. There's basically not much of a plot ("hey, what if there's this weird stranded alien and like, the military capture it and torture it, and, like, you know, it escapes and starts killing people...") and the fact the "monster" is  putatively an alien is irrelevant - it could just as easily be a giant poltergeist or a land-capable shark.  As always, Spielberg throws in tons of faux sentimentality (young teens rediscovering the importance of fathers... sigh....) and close-up shots than serve only to reveal that no one in this flaccid production can act.  But all is not lost. If you are one of the many people out there who have difficulty falling asleep at the end of a stressful day, this is definitely the movie for you. It is so dreadful, so tedious, such an absolute waste of time and money that you'll be sound asleep within twenty minutes of the opening sequence. And for that contribution to somnolence everywhere this movie deserves the one star rating I've given it.
 The title of my review is my actual review. I don't think this utterly dull POS merits any more effort being expended.
 The movie has no real plot, and the characters are not believable at all.  The 'alien' is kept in shadows at all times like used to happen in the really old sci-fi movies where it was done due to how hard it was to make the alien believable.  Attempts to communicate with the alien are just absurd, and lead to an anti-climatic ending.  This is like a modern version of those really, really bad sci-fi B-movies of the 50's and 60's.
 the movie was slow to action & 90% of the movie was too dark so you really cant see whats happening. wasup with that? then it was almost predictable but boring...please dont waist $10 like i did. kids even lost interest and fell asleep lol
 I would seriously like to slap the snot out of whoever did the sound on this film. We rented this from Amazon. We have a home theatre system. The quiet conversations interspersed with frequent DEAFENING crashes, explosions, screams, etc. make it nearly unwatchable! I rode the remote the ENTIRE time, which is absolutely no fun, and my upstairs neighbors actually stomped on their livingroom floor at least 3 times because some of the scenes were so suddenly loud I couldn't possibly keep the volume at one steady level and still hear what the actors were saying.  Why do filmmakers do this? It's obnoxious. And this film is one of the worst offenders. I guess if we'd gone to see this in a theatre, we'd have come home with blood streaming from our ears. I'd really like to watch it again because the cast was uniformly great and the story attention-grabbing -- but I won't, because of this one issue. Had it not been a streaming rental and a DVD instead, I might have watched it again -- with English captioning and NO sound.
 Preposterous plot. Characters with no depth. Bad SFX. Gawd awful. No worth the time I spent watching it. Save your money.
 Insipid sentimentality with production values and a big soppy musical score. And a derivative plot, utterly predictable. Has the worst aspects of King and Spielberg.
 Initially, I was going to just buy this, but I saw it at Redbox the other day and decided to rent it instead.  There's $1.20 absolutely wasted.  I had relatively high expectations of this movie.  With Abrams and Spielberg working collaboratively, I figured it would have to be good in some ways.  I was wrong.  I don't know if it could have been more hokey, cheesy, or cliche if they tried.  Poor sullen kid loses mom, and dad has to finally be a parent (ooh. gripping.).  The drunk neighbor is ridiculous.  Ooh.  Again.  "Stay away from my daughter".  Lame.  Then we have the sad alien who only wants to return home (ET, but more angry and on steroids?).  Amazingly, everyone comes away from a full on-train derailment with barely a scratch.  The person who DRIVES A TRUCK HEAD ON into it miraculously lived long enough to be killed by the USAF.  Lovely.  Stupid 'tween puppy love? Check. Ridiculous story line?  Check. Utterly predictable ending?  Check. 1 hour and 50 some minutes of my life I'll never get back?  Check.  Those who rave must have seen another movie or are just blinded by the names attached to this movie.  Bottom line
 Well, I took a chance on it and my instincts were right. This is Spielberg trying so hard to get the freshness of ET and the creativity of "Amazing Stories" . It's a mish-mosh combination that goes off the rails.  The film actually starts off producing mild interest for the first twenty five minutes. Some annoying half teen/half something else kids of 1979 suburbia are working on making a home style movie. That's about the only part that held my interest because I had done the same as a youngster, but after the big train wreck, this monstrosity goes on and on with noise and nonsense. The kids get caught up in some military generated creature bs (or restrained alien- who knows) that plays out like a far fetched kiddie film. Most movies generate improbability, but this film throws in the kitchen sink and more as it scrambles for high octane interest.  The creature is so wicked and destructive that no one in their right mind, let alone a kid, would want to come near the thing. The CGI seems old school and detracts as the monster who is wisely hidden with glimpses reveals itself. Of course one pre- teen boy can stop this fiend in it's tracks with vocal civility. Sub plots including a weirdly displayed kid crush and conflicting dads fall flat all around. Remove the sci -fi aspect and you have big screen Hallmark movie. A concoction of metal, lights and crud is whipped up to create an excuse of an ending. It couldn't come fast enough for this dud.
 No wonder the trailer was extremely vague, they had to spark SOME interest and trick people into watching this film. And everyone would have just thought, 'oh, an E.T. remake'. Some Remakes can be tweaked and great, but this movie was horrible. The expectations were high considering the producer and director. What a let down. The story line was just like in E.T., the only thing different was E.T. was like E.T. on meth and steroids. Catch this film if it's available on redbox for $1 or when it plays on tv, but definitely not worth the $3.99 and anticipation. If you hate movies that are really quiet when you need to hear what is being said, then obnoxiously and unnecessarily loud, definitely avoid this one. The cinematography was also horrible. Really hated this film and I love Sci-Fi. What a disappointment.
 The school year is ending, which means less homework and more opportunities to go to the movies on weekdays.  My daughters wanted to see "Super 8" because my youngest had heard from a friend in school that one scene made her scream aloud.  I myself was not sure what to make of a film touted as an "homage" to another producer/director.  But JJ Adams has made some very solid movies in my opinion, so it couldn't be all bad.  And it wasn't.  My daughters were duly frightened and pronounced it a very good movie.  But I found myself thinking about the plot during those moments when the pace of the movie seemed to slow.  First thought that hit me was these events were taking place when Jimmy Carter was president.  He never seemed like the type of chief executive that would have approved of secret and not so nice air force programs to exploit captive aliens.  Then I began wondering why a lowly colonel ran the whole program and why he had been in charge for apparently a number of years.  And then I wondered why heavily armed national guardsmen wearing flak jackets were evacuating a town threatened by a wildfire.  Seemed a bit like overkill if you asked me?  The sight of those guys on the street would have led to me START asking questions rather than blindly following their directions.  Plus, fuel trucks don't blow up if you shoot them with a rifle (see the Mythbusters series).  Well, I guess it doesn't pay to look for holes in a plot because undoubtedly they exist in all movies.  But then again, if the film had engaged me throughout, I guess I would not have had the time to mull over the plot.  The acting on the part of the kids was excellent - Elle Fanning especially.  Some aspects of the film - like the kids making a zombie movie - were also brilliant.  The casting for the adults, however, seemed a bit stereotypical.  The bad Air Force colonel had to look bad, etc. I felt like I had to explain the concept of posse comitatus to my kids when I got home. I also have trouble comparing the monster to ET when I learned that it apparently ate people.  Seemed a bit more CLOVERFIELD-ish and thus much less sympathetic.
 This movie falls flat on its face trying to be the "ET" of today's generation. A predictable plot, tired character roles, and a boring take on "other life" are all throw into a blender and comes out a muddy, soupy mess in the end. There is no satisfaction to be had watching this film if you are over the age of 12. If you are 11 and younger - enjoy!
 great preview..lousy movie. It really did seem like a bunch of kids made this movie. Just really bad plot & bad acting.
 I had high hopes for this movie, but it was so filled with countless plot holes and so badly written, that the group of us watching were falling off our chairs by the end with laughter.  It played like a frantic fever dream, jumping from one non-nonsensical scene to another.  By the end, we were rooting for the army to destroy the evil alien who killed countless innocent people, destroyed a town, and left an entire community broken.  In the end, it flies away, powered by the locket that the main characters mother's gave him.  Who knew an intergalactic spaceship could be powered by schmaltz.  There were many scenes that were introduced that did nothing to advance the story or deepen the understanding of the characters.  The mother's death by a steam beam did not impact the story or really the main character.  You really felt nothing for the child, because that emotional pain was not connected with the story.  The conflict with the father and the drunk man responsible for his wife's death was also meaningless.  Why spend a scene on that?  Here are a couple of items for thought
 Derivitive. Predetor, Aliens, ET, Close Encounters , War of the Worlds+Cloverleaf etc. all rolled into on unmemorable mess.  Follows the usual Spielbergesque formula...monsters+drippy sentimentalism+smart a.ss kids+comic relief druggie dude.
 They focus way to much on making us try to care about the characters, and fail. First 20 minutes of the movie could be deleted. The movie is 80% about some kids making a movie and the romantic connection between two of the kids. When E.T. goes home in the end, we're supposed to care and be happy for it. Fail. Very slow moving movie.
 First of all I've never written a review on Amazon before but I felt compelled to do so simply because of the number of 5 star reviews for this film. A person who's on the fence about purchasing this movie might be swayed simply by all of the reviews without renting it and I just had to offer an objective counterpoint after having finally seen the movie. People may genuinely like this movie, hey more power to them and this is just my opinion.  I went into the movie pretty stoked because of the initial previews for it. I then read some of the professional reviews and they were pretty positive. So I knew going in that this was essentially a 2-hour love letter to all things Spielberg-ian, much less classic Spielberg when he could do no wrong, so I was even more psyched! And then I watched the film.  The biggest two films that this movie borrows/steals heavily from are Close Encounters and E.T. And those two movies had one thing in common right off the bat - they hooked the audiences in. Immediately. Everyone's seen them so I won't rehash why their hooks worked. This film had no such hook - or at least not the hook you'd suspect in a movie heavily advertised as a summer action/sci-fi film. I knew something was off when they focused on the main character Joe, a roughly 15 year old kid, and then proceeded to drag out the opening. I was still psyched mind you, just less enthusiastic about the movie. And the opening was thoughtful and emotional but just not what I expected. I thought we were going to hit the ground running with the kids filming their Super 8 movie, establish quick backgrounds, and then the train derailment would hit and all hell would break loose. It didn't. We're introduced to Joe and all of his buddies and the I-couldn't-see-that-coming-1000-miles-away love interest and we eventually get to where the previews had me hyped. And then that crapped out.  It seems that the movie's sideplot of Joe's relationship with his friends, potential girlfriend, and his father took up roughly 75% of the movie and the "other" plot with the alien was about 25%. Keep in mind these numbers are based on my first viewing and could be off, it's simply what it felt like to me as it unfolded. You get a quick scene with the alien and then back to the much longer friends scenes. Repeat that formula a few times and there's the movie. It just wasn't properly focused. You'd get the action going and then dial it all the way back down to zero.  And then I was just amazed at the homage scenes to Spielberg. They were pretty blatant. The airforce guys who rush out of NOWHERE with flashlights at the derailment was a rip-off of E.T. as was a couple of city shots at dusk. All of the dysfunctional family scenes with Joe's buddy, the budding director, were completely ripped-off from Close Encounters as was a town evacuation scene. There was even a quick utility truck scene driving through the countryside that I would've sworn was from Close Encounters. In fact all of Joe's buddy's are simply knock-off versions of the kids in Stand By Me and, to a lesser extent, Goonies. And I won't ruin the ending but even a certain element of that basically copied E.T.  And I won't even get into actual plot holes with the government agents and the biology teacher as that'd ruin the movie with potential spoilers because if you see it I'd rather you not know everything. But I will say this to all of the 5-star reviewers - after watching this did the kids in any way forward the plot with the alien? IMO they did not - events would've unfolded without them anyways except for one single rescue scene. The main character's(the kids) that were focused on in no way helped or hindered the alien plotline. We could've essentially replaced the kids with a group of rogue monkeys that escaped from a zoo and accidentally recorded the alien. Can't go wrong with monkeys for comedic relief.  Anyways there you go. Sorry for the length of the review - I just wanted to explain why this just didn't work for me and warn you if you're expecting a whimsical, tightly knit action-filled sci-fi film you'll be in for a surprise as that's definitely not what this is. It's a tale of friendship and a coming of age story. With an alien. And that would be fine but it wasn't in any way promoted as such.  Please rent this first before just blindly buying it. And to everyone who loves it, great. I'm not full of hate for this movie, just massive disappointment for what it could have been, based on the previews. My one star rating will be considered harsh as the acting overall was decent and the effects worked, but the overall stuttering plot just didn't do it for me. To me a 5-star film is pretty flawless with the storyline and plot, that's why I'm amazed at all of the 5-stars out there. You truly think this is a perfect film? A masterpiece? You'll return to this over and over again throughout the years like you would with a true, much less original, 5-star film?  I'll just stick with the far superior source material(s) instead of this.  Peace
 When the movie first started, I thought, "This is a great little movie." I loved the interaction with the kids, and think if Abrams could have kept the focus on that storyline (with the sci fi monster), it might have been a nice little flick ala "Stand By Me." Instead, it was a sappy, heavy-handed lecture on letting go and surviving through pain. It wasn't a big inspirational, the monster left a LOT to be desired. They could have easily chopped off 45 minutes in this movie and filled it with something else. The writing is poor, the special effects are stupid, and the story veers off in so many different directions it appears childish.  One bright note was watching the "kids movie" at the very end. But don't bother watching the whole thing just to get there.
 the movie was shot in such dark scenes that you could not see half of the movie. Most of the movie is soo unbelievable that its annoying. Don't bother. Heck I dont think I will watch any more movies from with JJ Abrams of Speilberg.
 i don't understand what do Spielberg with this film try to copy ET or GOONIES?? how an ALIEN make a ship with garbage! and why wait 40 years to do that! or simply this movie is a precuel of CLOVERFIELD is the clone????? better movie of monster is THE TROLL HUNTER
 After the first ten minutes of the movie, I was ready for a nonstop sci-fi thrill ride. I was extremely disappointed. The rest of the movie is completely disjointed and has no idea what it should be. Way to many plot lines and none are fully resolved.  And just out of curiosity, why would the AIR FORCE put the world's most valuable military secret on an unguarded train; traveling through the middle of the country?
 I usually like work from JJ Abrams (Star Trek, LOST), but this movie was REALLY disappointing.  My husband and I rented thinking, oh the reviews are good so let's give it a try.  The plot, the characters, the beginning, the middle, the ending --- all of it was extremely boring.  I would've stopped watching it after first 15 minutes, but I figured I'd see what the good ratings were about.  One of the worst I've rented this year.
 I wander who's the target audience for this flick. The pickup ramming and destroying a million ton train. ET running around killing killing everybody. Looks more like a spielburg movie than JJ Abrams.
 A cute, big eyed alien lands in a saucer, befriends children on bicycles, and makes a phone call. It is a very cute British children's film from 1955 called SUPERSONIC SAUCER. It was laughable watching Spielberg remake this film in 1977 as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (several versions; he strives for perfection, after all) and in 1982 as E.T., not to mention 1987 as *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED. He continues to remake this British film. It is now vomitous. Are we not lucky to have "fresh" visions and "talented" filmmakers among us? Look up at the sky with a stupid expression if you disagree.
 This was one of the worse movie ever made, it was another Cloverfield. We lost interest after 15 minutes, the previews made it look good, but it wasn't. The kids did great, they have a future in acting. Rent it if you don't believe me but don't waste your money buying it, it is a watch once movie.
 This is another very lame and cliche film about aliens.  The story was incredibly predictable and was pretty weak.  I felt cheated after watching.
 I so wanted to like this. I mean with names like Speilberg and JJ Abrams, I thought this would be great. I'm a huge "Fringe fan, but this movie lacked any of that vitality. The kids were okay, but the plot line was weak, the acting poor and it never seemed to work, for me anyway.  For being blu-ray, and having a few action scenes, particularly the train accident, it could have been so much more intense.  Sadly, all this taught me is this
 I am so displeased that I've been waiting one month for the Super 8 movie I have paid for. I had to review this seller. Even thought after they read this I may never ever get my DVD. I will say I hate the idea of reviews and scores for I am in sales. So it took alot for me to write this. Tho I'm sure they knew it was coming.  They take the cake for buyer beware unhappy experience. DO NOT Buy from them. I think I could have made the movie by now. this was the first order I placed on Amazon, lol nice welcome
 This was so bad! We walked out of it. It tries to capture that whole Spielburgesque feeling, you know, with kids on the bikes in a suburb looking for adventure, but fails completely. What plays out is extremely tedious. It's nothing more than a B monster movie with every character a boring stereotype.
 Another movie where the government is the bad guy. The monster, which kills people and hangs them upside down, however, is just misunderstood. Plus, the plot is a badly disjointed patchwork of ideas stolen from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"  "E. T." , "Jaws" and Stephen King's "Tommyknockers.". Save your money.
 Very Boring movie.  Really did not like it. It was good at first then it just went sour after about 20 minutes.  Hated It!
 Have you ever witnessed (no, not seeing a video with little perspective) of a fast moving freight train hitting a vehicle?  I have long ago while working for the Union Pacific;  I was working for the U.P. and sitting trackside on a "ballast machine" knowing that the freight was about to come thru....thus making it requisite to pull into a siding which was there for such purposes.  A truck driver with suicide on his mind pulled onto the tracks just as the freight was approaching.  Yes, there is debris flying through the air ahead of the impact area but any normal freight (75 to 100+ cars) will just slice right through the vehicle....there is no threat of a derailment under normal circumstances (such as an improperly maintained trackage) and will continue to pass through while the engineer attempts to stop the train.  It is a horrendous event to witness (the driver was killed immediately) but something with the tonnage of a freight train is not going to go flying in all directions.  J.J. Abrams has a wild imagination as shown in his earlier works....but the premise of a derailment is simply ridiculous.  And be prepared to describe the events before a Coroner's Jury!  Nothing more, nothing less.
 Save Your $3.99.  There is a reason that there is a Facebook page called "Super 8 Is The Worst Movie Ever.  I rented this thinking it was a Steven King movie.  Instead I got Stand By Me, Meets ET and District 9.  Totally predictable and uninteresting.
 Who let Spielberg get away with highway robbery? Who turned their heads & allowed this guy 2 steal this kind of $$$ 4 this garbage?! No 1 was watchin' the cookie jar when he put his hand in & emptied it! This movie should have gone str8 2 the dumpster right out the camera! The kids did a good job with what they had 2 work with. Who ever created this mess should be flogged! Horrendous story! Good job kids! Not worth the harddrive it was saved on! I rate this a -5!!!
 This movie was awful. To have it be compared to E.T. and other great movies like that was ridiculous. I couldn't wait for the movie to end and then the ending was even worse then the actual movie.
 Not sure what movie many people were watching based on the reviews praising the film but I found the story line just to be ok and the ending to be really dumb. It felt like the film was trying to hit me over the head with some subtle political message (like Avatar).
 AWFUL!!!!  JJ Abrams needs to do better research if he wants to do Sci-Fi. The kid stops the alien from eating him by telling the creature, "I understand". What are you kidding?
 The audio track on the Blu-Ray is corrupt making it completely useless. The DVD works, but if I wanted to buy a DVD, I would have bought it as a DVD for less money. I heard of others having the same problem.
 This movie had so much potential!  There really could have been a real story, some depth.  There is not climax to this film and there's really just a surface story.  [SPOILERS]  They mention when the alien touches you, you understand it.  Yet they don't elaborate on this point.  They're just like 'here it is, we're not going to do anything with it.'  It could have been a great movie. I was so disappointed.
 this pathetic excuse for a movie took my money, wasted my time, my energy.  i can't believe Spielberg produced this utter ridiculous joke.  if you are 5 years old, then go see the movie, if you have a brain at all and an adult, please stay away as this garbage will suck the life out of and drain you dry.  really bad B movie is a good rating for this cheese wiz.
 Certainly not a family movie.  The story was completely boring and I could not wait till it was over.  There was a ton of needless cursing, especially by the children, and an F bomb, for what reason I have no idea other than more Hollywood brain washing to promote the cause that cursing is acceptable.  Thank goodness I rented it for free with a promotion through Redbox!
 This is pure garbage. The plot is ridiculous, and the dialog is really banal and laughable. After the train crash, which is very impressive, this movie takes a downturn to the level of a B movie turd. I wish I could get my money back, but at least I did not buy this stinkbomb!
 What exactly is the plot anyway?  Some "thing".  Some "monster".  Is it an alien?  Dracula?  Bigfoot?  A kitten?  The reviews here are mostly horrible too, which makes the title seem too forced.  Most of these reviews read like they were written by promoters for the movie itself.  Thanks, I'm sure you want me to think your product is great.  That's implicit in its mere existence.  But that does nothing to convince anyone.  It only adds to the lack of clarity and pointlessness by making it seem forced.  "Umm, guys?  This title is a bomb, so let's talk it up so we at least make back our investment.  "Haha, yeah!  Why actually make something decent when we can just force it down peoples' throats by artificially interfering with their purchase decisions?  Now to make thoughts like this seem stupid, half the reviews will be removed or rewritten, and a reply left to say, "I don't see what you're talking about, derp.  Maybe not, but I look at it this way
 I tried to cancel my order before I watched it but I guess you can't do that. From the reviews that I read, I wasted money on a movie that I didn't see. Seems to be a good movie for children from what I read.
 For parents and kids like us who find it offensive, this film is loaded with swearing. It hardly ever lets up. My husband and I don't recall that 2 of the words were even in use in 1979. I didn't like that 3 of the 4 helpful adults in this movie used drugs or alcohol. The special effects are great. I think the story is weak and as a sci-fi fan I would have liked more of the "science" explained and more alien involvement other than simply throwing junk straight up in the air for most of the movie.  There is very little humor although one boy has perfect timing remarking on methods of suicide. (You would have to hear him, it's not as bad as it sounds.) All the kids did a pretty good job acting as their quirky characters. But if you find bad language offensive, I'd skip this one. Our son left the room halfway through. It was a Spielberg film and I wanted so much for it to get better, but I should have followed his example.
 Is anyone else sick of Speilberg using that same shot of people peering up at the sky with wondrous looks on their faces.  I mean he used it in Close Encounters, etcetera etcetera.  And is anyone sick of his terrible plot.  Watching his movies are like reading Stephen King.  Lots of fluff and amazing pyrotechnics by no story, no plot.  He just be banned from movie making.  What was this movie about?  A monster is trapped on earth, and waits to the movie to be made to build a spaceship?  What?  Stupid.  Just plain stupid.  And by the way, the little vignette of a Super 8 movie of the title made by the kid main characters and shown at the end with the credits was far better than the stupid movie which preceded it.
 Steven Spielberg has lost his touch for a long time now.  This is a terrible film.  The actors (kids) were very good.  This is one of those films that rarely shows you anything and use darkness to hide things instead of spending the money to show you.  I absolutely think this is one of the worst films of the year.  Please do not buy this.
 I CAN'T REVIEW THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO BUY COMBO PACKS.WHEN IT COMES OUT ON BLU-RAY BY IT SELF I MIGHT BUY IT.
 I'm not exactly sure what audiences saw in this movie? I had an open mind about the direction of the story line and hoped for the best as I sat and munched my popcorn. I can't express how disappointed I was at this weak effort of this movie. First, the casting of the main characters was completely ridiculous. How they ever found such an inept bunch of pre-teen actors is beyond comprehension. The dialog between the cast was annoying at best. Not one of them could finish a line without interrupting each other making it a useless wall of noise (Directors fault). In short, this movie just doesn't accomplish its goal of making you feel something for the characters and the alien. In that case, I leave you with this...  What is the point then?
 ...that rate a product before it is even available!  What lots of idiots do not understand is that if they want to rate the movie they should go to IMDB.com.  If they want to rate the DVD or blu-ray they have to wait until it is available and they have tried it out.  How do they know what the video and audio quality is going to be?  The packaging, the extras etc.?  Of course ultimately it is Amazon's fault for allowing reviews of a non-existing product.  So once again, for all the mentally slow people, DVDs and blu-ray discs are *products* an important *part* of which is the movie and/or TV episodes on it and their quality but that is far from being the *only* criterion by which they should be judged!  Ergo, you actually need to have experienced the product before you can rate it!
 ET? Goonies? Wake Up! Are Classics, this is poor trash. What Happend with the real tributes? 1/2 - Star in my concept.
 Are you kiddin me, what a waste of a perfect bluray. Do not purchase. Warning,warning cannot believe Spielberg put his name on this bust.
 I don't enjoy writing serious reviews, and I'm not enjoying this so I suppose that would make sense.  In summary, don't watch this movie, and definitely don't pay money to own it forever, so it's sat on your shelf next to decent films like the Goonies and Gigli.  People judge you by the things you own (not me of course, I'm from an environmentally friendly pygmy tribe who spend our time helping others); don't allow them to hate you or think you are a stupid head because you have this movie on display.  After a lifetime of character development and build up, you conclude that the kids are annoying and unlike-able, and the most annoying one (the fat bully) is so lame that they couldn't be bothered to write him out of the ending properly (cus he'd have ruined it even more).  What's worse is that they try to redeem him with a one-liner at the same time, and that's when you really (really) start to feel shafted.  I won't spoil the ending, you can watch it yourself if you want that to happen; but even the Alien franchise hasn't stooped so patronisingly low by asking me to u-turn, and sympathise with the monster I'm supposed to fear.  And now I can't stop thinking about how annoying the fat kid was. Damn these user reviews.
 Star Classics version of THE SEVERED ARM is unfortunately the Cut TV Version and not the UNCUT and UNCENSORED Version offered by the defunct VIDEO GEMS.
 lots of low-quality stuff that has been circling around for years, also lots of ripping-off of other companies without paying them. Overall
 This is not the DVD version of Speak of the Devil. Speak of the Devil was an incredible live album of ALL BLACK SABBATH songs performed by this band. I can't believe I'm the first person to point this out.
 I haven't, and won't, buy this DVD. I can only assume that this was either edited, or, as someone else suggested, is a totally different concert than the bootleg I saw. The one I saw had Ozzy hanging a little person from the upper rafters of the stage who he called "Ronnie"... This is completely tasteless. That is probably why this has never been released before. I believe the joke of a human being that he has become (Shaaaaroooon!) probably has something to do with karma.... Also, someone was asking why Ozzy doesn't use that effect on his voice where it sounds double more often. The reason is that this is impossible to do live. Unlike true artists, Ozzy records over every live album he has released so that you don't hear how crappy it really sounds.
 Once upon a time I owned this great vinyl album, then I bought a cd player. One day I saw "Speak of the Devil" on CD so I bought it. I took it home and listened to it and was shocked to learn that they omitted "Sweet Leaf" from the disk. I guessed that they  wussed out to the "Say No" crowd. Well, Wikipedia says they ran into CD time restrictions and decided to omit a song. I can't believe the song is omitted from the DVD. The song is totally awesome unless you are retarded. Get the CD with Sweet Leaf and you will be happier.
 I bought this brand new and every single disk in the set had huge gashes and scratches. It will not play half of the episodes because of the damage. This item was still wrapped when I got it so this damage happened in the factory. Not happy and I couldn't get my money back or return it....
 this is going to seem a biased Review to some , and perhaps rightfully so  but I base it on the assumption that "quality" and "Literal translation" must be considered synonomous  The Subtitle on this show is a polite nod as they dont even include the option of changing the credits so you dont see the case closed logo (Maybe that was a neccessity of Including so many episodes for so low a price but I wish I'd known...)  I'd rather own the Original  and practice my jappanese with it personally  Down with Dubbing.
 Jimmy Stewart playing a harmonica? Maybe in l941 America had its mind on the war and movies, like this one, were very loosely put together. Paulette Goddard plays her usual kinda dingy part. It is interesting to see Horace  Heidt's band again. A young Art Carney is spotted in this not-so-unusual  plot of struggling musicians, love on the fly, rushing here and there to  make the auditions and play dates. You wonder how hunger these actors were  to play in this movie or was it made on furlough for the folks at home.

 The DVD is very close to the bible for a small part,especially Jesus' miracle signs that jesus didn't also like. I'm not a pharisee. There is no idea and messange of jesus.
 The four movies included in this set -- 'Disorder In The Court', 'Malice In The Palace', 'Sing A Song Of Six Pants' and 'Brideless Groom' -- are in the public domain, which means anyone with recording equipment and a copy  of the movie can release their own video. Frequently, the results are of  poor video/audio quality (although the movies themselves are quite good --  'Brideless Groom' is one of the funniest Stooge comedies ever). Columbia  has just released an 'official' Stooges DVD (with six of the films on one  disc) -- hopefully the first of many. Stick with Columbia, and avoid these  cheap knock-offs.
 Not as good as I Love Lucy these four episodes of her later show don't do Lucy justice. Another thing is the quality. DVD's are supposed to be of high quality but they used a very bad film copy when they made this. It  even jumps in a couple places! I'm taking mine back to the store.
 I found these movies to be extremely formulaic.  The plot wasn't all that bad though and seemed to at least move.  The most disappointing factor of all is that it's on DVD and the sound is terrible.  You can't understand  half of what they say.  It sounds like they recorded off of a bad speaker  that keeps popping.  At one point the film even scrolls.  Disappointing use  of media, okay plot, excellent for camp value.
 Did not care for this movie at all! Boring and worthless plot! Wish I could get my time and money back!
 This is the most terrible mass-appeal ... film in quite a while. Why? Because it's pretending to be something it's not. Couldn't you have guessed that already from the pretentious title? When people are watching this it's like "let's marvel at the amazing ... and feel sorry for his perpetually tormented psyche." yay. Whoever feels they've learned something from watching this film, or been profoundly moved, they're seeing something (substance) which is not really there. Academy Awards' best film of the year, based on the true story of a great man and mathematician, the amusing thrills of his building hallucinations and the mystery of what's real and what's not, thus sharing the confused point of view with Nash - how could it not be great? Well, I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief that this was anything more than a produced and manufactured film written at the level of a young adult fiction story which was meaningful in clothing but a stick figure underneath...or something... There's just nothing there. I don't know what else to say. Yeah, you people feel sorry for Nash when you watch this. But if you met the real Nash you wouldn't be nearly so sympathetic. That really makes me mad. Leave the people you consider 'different' ... alone if all you want is entertainment and not actually be interested in learning anything (whether it be in an emotional, philosophical, artistic or informative sense) or at least be real with them. This ...movie was a hit and won 4 Academy Awards. ...Beautiful Mind is misleadingly presented as if it were a deep film or something. It's quite anger-inspiring, like a high school cheerleader girl who feigns confidence but is secretly insecure. And most people don't even notice she's pretending. I bet few people will find this review helpful.
 I think so!  A Beautiful Mind is "Movie Of The Week" material that at times seems to parody mental illness.  It misses it's mark from start to finish. Russell Crowe's job wasn't Oscar worthy in my opinion. And this is quite possibly one of Ed Harris' worst on screen performances. He's such a great actor. How did he get talked into this role?  Since I wasted my $...at the theater, I don't intend on wasting double that to own this disappointment. A big blemish on Ron Howard's otherwise notable directing career.  Use the $$ for a pizza and a movie rental from your local video store.
 If they had an Academy Award for most-hyped movie, this one would win. It was dull. Period. I think Ron Howard's ego finally got the better of him.  Looking at the trailer you probably got the impression this was a about a math genius who was working for the government and had some sort of mental disorder (at least that's what I thought). Without giving too much of the movie away, it's about a dull nerd who's lost in delusions. And I have to admit, I spent a lot of time fast forwarding, otherwise I would've ejected it.  There was a scene in the beginning of the movie where professors perform some pen ceremony on a prestigious faculty member
 I should have walked out of this movie 30 minutes into the show. I am amazed at the level of "cookie-cutter" sentimentality and plot ploys that were contrived to produce this movie. The dialogue was so lame I found myself audibly snorting in disbelief. And what about Jennifer Connelly? Was that acting? Rusell Crowe did a two-star job under horrible, flat directing. A Beautiful Mind insults all of our original and good instincts. What a piece of garbage!!
 I heard that this was a great movie, so I decided to rent it.  I was very disappointed with the movie.  Most of the time, I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't.  I definitely would not recomment this movie to anyone.
 I never liked this guy. He was never interesting. I thought he was less intelegent than his peers. As for the Movie...... I love Ron Howard but this one was a Dead film....  I watched it again
 This was probably the most confusing (& boring) movie I've tried to watch in a long time.  The critics gave it such rave reviews that I should have known it would be a real snore!
 I absolutely, 150% HATED this movie!...  After getting so many great reviews and winning 4 Oscars, I was excited to see this movie.  What a disappointment it turned out to be! The acting wasn't terrible on the actors and actresses part, but the whole plot was horrific! I can't believe this movie got such great reviews! ... It's such a shame such an amazing and inspiring story was put to pieces.
 this movie confused the hell out of me, probably because i read the book (excellent).  unfortunately terribly inaccurate and unnecessarily sentimental fluff in hollywood = garner awards and praise  that blonde in the bar scene is just awful and a completely incorrect notion of a nash equilibrium.
 I couldn't relate to or appreciate this movie.  Actors seem unworldly and certainly like no one I ever knew.
 Many a source material have lent themselves quite admirably to the cinematic arts. Think of any successful page-to-screen translation (it'll come to you). Sadly, however, this adaptation of the book of the same name could only leave the viewer wanting rather than entertained or enthralled. Whether it was the leaden pace, the stilted, almost comical dialogue or the complete absence of any discernible direction I cannot say with any degree of certainty, having neither the desire nor the $3.50 to rent this movie. However, I can state with some assurance that as an individual who has experienced far more than his fair share of emotional, physical and financial disappointment that this film, like almost everything that has transpired in my life, would undoubtedly fall far short of even my meager, ever dwindling expections....
 I never had the fortune or misfortune to watch this movie because it won't play and I can't contact the seller.
 I can handle a B-movie horror flick, own 100's of them. this is the absolute worst of the series!
 I bought this almost a year ago at Wal-mart because the front cover says
 This was another waste of $14+.  The acting was fair, but the story was weak and disjointed.  This is yet another in a long line of failures in the "AfterDark Horrorfest."  If you absolutely MUST watch this DVD, rent it.  Don't buy it.  Really.  It's not worth keeping.
 I was in the video store today looking for a good horror movie. My mom suggested Mulberry Street. On the front it said, "A Zombie film that breaks the mold." I like Zombie movies and I happen to like a FEW of the After Dark Horror Fest Movies. So as I'm sitting here watching it, I start falling asleep. It start's off very slow and picks up about half way in the middle of the movie. It has NOTHING to do with Zombies what so ever. So people are bitten by rats and become rat people not zombies. What a waste of money but I'm happy that I didn't buy this [...]. If you like stupid horror movies then watch it [I happen to love cheesy horror movies but this was [...]] other wise, don't waste your time.
 This Movie Was Awful!Its like a remake of the graveyard shift. I was not scared one bit total BS! Do not buy this unless Rats scare you.
 the other reviewers gave away the story so these people did see the movie, ratings are unbelievable. system wont allow zero stars. this is pure garbage. slowly builds to the most stupid zombie type plot. 28 days-ish but for a kindergarten film class.
 Seems like this plot has been re-written a million times.  Great movie to show for a troubled school when a teacher doesn't show up.
 Stay far away from this movie.  Looks like it was shot for 50 cents.  Boring, hard to get past first 10 minutes!
 this movie was terrible.  i want my 1.30 back.  the writing is just ridiculous, unbelievable on all accounts. no wonder it grossed 30 dollars.  how anyone could give this movie 5 stars is beyond me.
 I watched this movie and it's crapy,crapy and you will never get the 1 hour and 25 mins.back from your life so please don't buy it if anything rent it like I did and save money and for me its not good at all....
 The worst movie I ever experienced. Lousy on all counts.. Hated it! I would not recommend and so disappointing even the ending was hokey. My husband fell asleep. Wish I had not ordered this one, when there are much better acting and movies that have real content. The ending even sucked, although could not wait for it to be over.
 No knocks on the two movies-- they're both worth seeing.  The issue here is the product itself. This MADACY gray box series is of the lowest possible quality. Their SLP dubs track poorly and have degraded video of unrestored public domain stock.  Truth is, at that snail's pace speed they could've fit three or four films on a single VHS instead of issuing this double dose space-waster.  Best advice to anyone still purchasing videotape
 I was FORCED to give at least 1 star.  I would have given a 0 or asked for one back... I have three different versions of Africa Screams and this is by far the worst transfer I've ever seen.  Goodtimes Home Video has Africa Screams on DVD (6.99 @ Wal-Mart) and looks as good as anything Universal has ever put out for A&amp;C. Sound and video on these DVD's are worse than the VCD I picked up on EBay for 5 bucks.   This is the third DVD I have from MADACY and they are ALL very poor quality.  The video tapes would look much better.  This is a waste of money at any price.  Others companies (Goodtimes Home Video and Platinum) have the same movies.  I suggest those.
 Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash. The video transfer from film is very poor, but the worst is the audio. Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality  legacy DVD's, just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out  Charlie Chaplin DVD's). This is a shame because younger folks who've never  seen these classics may walk away with the wrong impression. If you really  want these titles get this one, it looks cheaper than ASIN B00000IC8F  (which has the same titles &amp; release dates).  But Caveat Emptor folks.

 if i could give this 0 stars, nothing could get this to play. the audio stunk. the video stunk even more. not worth any price. if anyone knows a way to get a version of this that is watchable, feel free to point it out in your review.
 I have just received my copy of Africa Screams/Jack and the Beanstalk and I'm seriously considering returning it. In this day of computer enhancements and digital restorations why does this transfer look like it was done by a blind, deft Saint Bernard. I have over three hundred DVD's to date in my collection and I have never seen a transfer this bad. It appears to have been copied from a third generation VHS tape originally recorded at SLP speed. The scratches, dropouts' lack of contrast and poor sound quality makes this DVD a waste of money. The color in Jack in the Beanstalk continually shifts and bleeds through each scene and the black and white sequences also shift from B&amp;W to blue at scene changes. Add to that the same scratches and lack of picture quality as Africa Screams gives you two inexcusably bad copies for the price of one. I for one, will not purchase any more transfers from MADACY in Canada
 I LOVE these Peanuts animations, but the sound is terrible. The thing that glues all the Charlie Brown features together is the Vince Guaraldi soundtracks, which are the third dimension to all the Peanuts specials -- and are arguably better than the animation itself. Alas, in all these "remastered and unremastered DVD versions of the Peanuts classics, whoever mastered them was no musician

 I cannot believe I just paid $1.99 to rent this. I thought it was going to be a movie. It is misleading. All it is, is an author trying to promote his book. he told a couple of ghost stories, and just talked about his book mostly. To be honest, i had to check to make sure this wasn't a trailer for a movie, but it was supposed to be a movie. I wish I could get my money back. I cannot even imagine why they would charge $25.00 to buy this. Maybe if it were an actual movie, but it wasn't even slightly remotely a movie, just some guy saying over and over to buy his book. Unbelievable. I just got ripped off.
 Look, I say this a lot when I give something a one star review- I don't just give out this rating. To get one star, a movie has to legitimately make me mad, and Bereavement did just that in a number of ways. This feels like a Sci-Fi channel original movie that got a slightly better than average budget, and some good looking ladies. Apart from that, there's NOTHING positive I can say about Bereavement. Sure, it breaks a few rules of horror movies here and there, and how everything comes to a close towards the end isn't how most would expect, but that doesn't make it good by any means. Apparently this is a prequel to Malevolence, a movie that rarely got checked out when I worked at a movie store, and I'm definitely not in any hurry to see that one now.  The movie starts out with a young boy named Martin being abducted from his own backyard by a plain looking man, as his [easy on the eyes] mom interviews a potential nanny. He's taken to a slaughter house where the man takes young girls and kills them. Cut to a few years later and we meet the main character, Allison, who has moved from Chicago to the country with her uncle, aunt and niece because her parents died. She's still affected by the loss, and doesn't say much...until she meets a young man that tends to her wounds when she trips during jogging. Her uncle doesn't care for this kid and wants Allison to stay away from him. At the same time, girls are being taken away and brought to the slaughter house where the killer shows Martin his ways so he can follow in his footsteps. Martin hasn't broken free because he has a condition that makes him neutral to everything, and he doesn't feel physical pain either. One day, Allison sees Martin in the abandoned slaughter house as she passes by, and decides to see what's going on. I'm sure you know how that'll turn out.  I don't even know where to begin with my problems, so let me get the good things out of the way first. Yes I'm going to sound like a typical guy here, but good god were the two main actresses hot. Kathryn Meisle as Allison's aunt looked great in every scene she was in. And it was obvious that the director knew what he was doing during Alexandra Daddario's exercise scenes if you know what I mean. She was literally the one thing that held my interest during the movie. Other than that, the movie definitely had more of a budget than it deserved, so a lot of wounds looked fairly decent.  From what the plot summaries on various sites have said, I was expecting this to be a difficult to watch movie, but for different reasons than I ended up with. The cover alone showing a stranger with a young boy is always uncomfortable, and parents will always react stronger to situations like that. The movie starts out with the abduction, and was done well, but then it turns into a basic slasher movie that follows a pattern to the point where I was saying to myself 'here comes the next torture bit' and was right every time. It's hard to get why the antagonist is doing what he's doing too, but it ends up being comical at one point. Either he's crazy, possessed or trying to make up for something that happened a long time ago, or maybe it's all of the above. Who knows? It's never explained. The guy talks to steer skulls he has propped up on walls and other monuments around his home, and there's something covered up in a bed that he talks to. I was hoping that he'd pull the sheets back and reveal an animatronic cow talking to him. That would've made the movie a little more interesting. All of the characters are bland too, and are just there to get the job done in one way or another. I didn't care about any of them aside from Allison and her aunt for the reasons stated above. Characters die in the standard horror movie ways- gunshots, being hit over the head over and over, knives, axes, you name it. And yet you don't get to see a whole lot of it. The gore freaks out there will be disappointed knowing that even something like Children of the Corn showed more than this. Another point to bring up is how the killer is getting away with this for so long when it takes place in such a small town. He keeps a scrapbook of articles and notes about his victims, and it's clear he's been doing this for a long time, so how has no one caught him yet? There's a lot more to talk about but I don't want to ruin the 'shocking ending' for anyone. Let's just put it this way- it's certainly a 'wait...what??' moment, but more in the sense that you don't get why it happened. If you want an ending that really will shock you, watch Oldboy or I Saw the Devil. Bereavement's ending didn't do anything but have me asking 'seriously, you guys went that route?'.  The picture and audio quality were better than the movie itself, and I was grateful for that during key scenes involving Allison. Have I made it clear how much easier she made watching this movie? I didn't see any grain or other problems with the picture, and there were times when I was turning the sound down because the screams got so loud. All in all, no complaints here. Special features include a commentary track and deleted scenes...but they didn't work for me! When I'd select them, nothing happened. This is probably just an error with my disc, but it was good to see that they put something on here. If I had been able to see anything, I probably would've given the dvd a 2 out of 5 instead.  This is the kind of movie that makes me shake my head in shame at what's considered 'horror' these days, and then again at how many people praise something like this. Is it a generation thing? I'm just 26, and not one of those people that says all old horror movies are better than modern ones, but Bereavement isn't helping fight that argument in modern horror's favor. Maybe kids in their mid-teens will get more out of this one, or just people who like anything with blood. I almost want to boost the rating to 2 stars because of the leading ladies and the fact that they did at least put some special features on here, but that's no better than people praising this movie for it's obscenely lame ending and giving it 5 stars because of that.
 Movies should have some creative storytelling and not just use the crutch of retelling of the same plot for the umpteenth time. Proof
 "Bereavement" is supposedly the chilling prequel to "Malevolence," another supposedly chilling film.  However, after watching this dud, I have no plans on giving "Malevolence" a look.  "Bereavement" tells two stories at once.  Firstly, it gives us a look at the horrific childhood of Martin Bristol (Spencer List), who suffers from a condition that prevents him from feeling heat, cold, pain, etc.  He is kidnapped as a toddler by Graham Sutter (Brett Rickaby), a serial killer who has the same condition.  Sutter forces little Martin to witness and sometimes participate in the brutal murder of innocent and seemingly random women as Sutter tries to understand their pain.  The second story in this film is that of Allison Miller (Alexandra Daddario).  She moves from busy Chicago to the rural home of her uncle, Jonathan (Michael Biehn), and his family after her parents pass away.  As is always the case in movies, she is having a bit of trouble adjusting to her new home, but finds solace in her daily runs that pass in front of an abandoned slaughterhouse that is conveniently the home of Graham and Martin and their growing body count of dead girls.  The two stories come together when Allison notices Martin looking out of a window at the slaughterhouse and she decides to find out what is going on with the mysterious little boy.  Blood, guts, and gore ensue.  The film is nothing more than an excuse for the FX guys to chunk fake blood at the screen and the actors, for the director to attempt to gross you out with said fake blood, and for the actors to scream their heads off (every female in the movie) or passively go through the motions (Biehn).  I enjoy Biehn's work usually (especially in "Tombstone"), but he looked as if he didn't even want to be on set for the duration of the film.  Spencer List did little more than have a questioning look on his face the entire time.  Rickaby pulled off psycho fairly good, but wasn't enough to save the film.  Allison's love interest, William (Nolan Gerard Funk), did a decent job as well.  The victims over-acted as much as possible to sell how terrible their situation was.  Daddario gave a very thin performance, and in true virginal beauty Hollywood  fashion, wore a shirt that was just as thin.  While she was quite nice to look at, her performance was nothing to brag about.  Overall, "Bereavement" will most likely appeal to fans of hack trash like "Saw" and "Hostel," but it will never add much to an already bloated genre of weak films.  Not recommended.
 This movie is on the same sick level as the "Saw" movie series.... bloody, cold, violent and sick.  I actually had a hard time watching it but wanted to see it through to the end so I could properly review it.  I know there are those who enjoy watching this kind of movie, but it just isn't something I can recommend.  This movie shows the brutal killing of numerous innocent victims over many years.  The torture and fear the victims endured were equally sickening.  I would urge everyone to avoid this senseless, sick movie.  Whereas it may depict some degenerate part of our society I don't think we need to memorialize it on DVD.
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I make it a point of watching low budget b movies.  I expected a bad movie, lousy dialogue, bad acting.  But this was just an excuse to show the torture of young women.  A good horror movie, does a little more than just show degradation.  No suspense, no tense moments.  Obvious ending.  I can't believe I wasted time watching this drivel.
 I wanted to like this, because I love a good scare, I love blood and gore and I love violence in movies. Not all of the time, but some of the time. I mean, how can you be scared without violence and blood and gore. Well, you can be. Alfred Hitchcock could do it.  But this movie I couldn't watch. Once you start bringing the horror to children like they do here, I turn off. Women too, the scenes weren't necessary. I'll say it again, I couldn't watch this.
 Bereavement is the prequel to Mena's 2007 Malevolence. This movie shows the kidnapping of Martin Bristol, a six year old who cannot feel pain. A demented serial killer with the same condition takes him to make him an apprentice to his butchery of women. The movie progresses showing the child over the next few years as he witnesses and helps clean up after the slaughter of women in a former slaughterhouse. Allison, who loses her parents, comes to live with her uncle who is played by Michael Biehn and is soon drawn into the twisted world of the killer.  That is what the plot is supposed to be. What the movie is happens to be a mess of creative leaps with more holes than the most perforated swiss cheese.  SPOILERS BELOW!!! WARNING!  For example, the killer kidnaps Martin because Martin has the same disease. How does the killer know? Also, this takes place in a very small town. VERY SMALL. Yet, this killer has attacked and butchered dozens of women over the years, including two from this tiny town just in the few months of this movie. I have lived in a town this small. People would know. I promise. Also, the town creep in a small town is the first person a sheriff would shake down should something weird happen. A man takes a shotgun blast from a long distance and is dead instantly. The chances of this happening are very, very small. At every turn, Writer/Director Mena asks you to suspend belief, but you can only suspend yourself for so long before you fall.  Not even Michael Biehn can save this movie. His character is wooden and not very likeable, as his former Kyle Reese or Cpl. Hicks. In this, he mainly complains about the `no good' kid his niece wants to date. I hate seeing him relegated to the roll of grumpy old man.  If you like torture porn just for the torture, I guess there are a few scenes in here for you. But if you want a few incidentals like story, plot, and likeable characters, then get far, far away from this film.
 Don't listen to the people who go on and on about how sick and violent this movie is- if you pick it up on that basis, you're going to be disappointed. There's no actual torture here and no real gore. Just a bunch of standard stabbings and shootings with some blood splatter. The deaths are quick- this is NOT a torture movie. The kills are uncreative- just plain old stabbings mostly. You won't actually see much of the violence, either- the camera usually either cuts away and shows us blood splatter, or you just see darkened figures with no detail when the murders go down.  Low gore and uncreative kills can be saved by compelling characters or an interesting plot, but this movie has neither of those things. The plot is muddled and confusing. You think this movie will explain the fascinating psychology of a killer, but for the most part, it doesn't. The movie drags on and on, dull minute after dull minute, rarely revealing any new insights into the killers.  *SPOILERS*  The main killer is a crazy guy who thinks that steer heads and/or the body of his dead father and/or some scarecrow-like thing are ordering him to kill. He spends a lot of time screaming incoherent nonsense at these objects, which gets old fast. The source of his psychosis never becomes completely clear, but near the very end of the movie, the guy explains that he's killing humans to redeem himself for the fact that his father (who was a butcher) forced him to slaughter animals that trusted him. Um, OK? That still doesn't make a lot of sense.  The motives of the kidnapped boy, Martin, are even less clear. After living with the killer for 5 years, Martin still seems disturbed by the killings and even releases one girl at her request. Yet only days later, he's willingly leading a girl to her death and ignoring her cries for help. By the next day, he's already decided to start his own killing spree, despite the fact that he's been rescued from the kidnapper by that point. This sudden change in behavior is never explained at all. At one point, there's a classroom scene about "nature vs nurture" where a teacher says that a child raised in a hateful environment will become a carbon copy of the parents. So basically the explanation is just that this kid grew up with a killer and therefore became a killer himself? If the explanation is that simplistic, I can't fathom why we needed a 90 minute movie to explain it. And it still doesn't explain the kid's sudden change in attitude.  Martin could have been an interesting character. He has a disorder that causes him to be unable to feel physical pain. I thought maybe the killer would kidnap him, unaware of his disorder, and then torture him in a bunch of crazy ways, which Martin would be unaffected by due to his disorder, and which would either fascinate or frustrate the killer. But this most definitely does NOT happen. The killer is apparently somehow already aware of Martin's disorder, and he has no real interest in torturing him- he cuts him a couple times, but for the most part he hugs him and treats him as a son and an apprentice. So much less interesting than it could have been.  None of the other characters are particularly interesting or well-developed and they all just end up as victim fodder anyways. Also, it was hard to believe that this guy could kill so many local girls in a small town without arousing suspicions at all.  If you watch this because you want some creative kills, torture, and extreme gore, you'll be disappointed. If you watch it because you want a psychological thriller with an interesting storyline and characters and insights into the mind of a killer, you'll also be disappointed. There's really nothing here for anyone.
 I've just finished watching this HORRIBLE so called horror film. Please avoid this movie at all cost! I've been a horror fan for years and have never been compelled to leave a review until today. I know this is a prequel, i did not watch "MALEVOLENCE". After seeing this garbage, I never will. This is like ever other torture movie ever made
 Just when you think the horror industry cannot possibly find a way to release a more grotesque torture film, they do it. This is in no way creative, scary, or imaginitive. Just a high body count, and people being needlessly butchered. The film does not connect to the audience in any way, the story is boring, and everyone gets slaughtered when they are in helpless positions. Nobody even attempts to fight back, thus there is no suspense. Back in 1999, Stir Of Echoes, Blair With Project, Sixth Sense were all released in the same summer. Oh how the genre has fallen since that time.  On a bright note, films like this one, "Open House," and "Funny Games" are actually SO bad that it might convince producers to stop making these types of movies....but as long as people keep forking over money to see them, they will be made. Don't pay to watch this!
 SICK ! DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE. SICKEST OF THE SICKEST. FRED KRUEGER SEEMS LIKE A DISNEY CARTOON COMPARED TO THIS SENSELESS BLOODSHED. ONLY A SICK MIND CAN CREAT SUCH A HORROR. THE DEVIL MUST LOVE THIS MOVIE SINCE ONLY EVIL PREVAILS IN IT.
 Horror is one thing and I love horror movies.  But gore for its own sake is not even scary....it's simply sickening. There are no words awful enough to describe this nasty, evil, senseless, bloody piece of gore!!!!!!  What a sorry excuse for horror.  And shame on the parents who let their children act in this movie!!!!!! I only give it one star because there is no choice to give it zero stars which is what it deserves!!!!!!!
 This is a hack and slash movie that drones on endlessly in gory and gruesome detail, but is devoid of clever and compeling plot. The character devlopment is flat, the acting is poor, the script weak. I watched this with my husband and after one particularly bloody scene about an hour into the movie, we looked at each other and agreed "enough". Anchor Bay, the production company, appears to specialize in bad horror films. We were 'treated' to approx. 5-6 endless coming attractions that made no sense except to let us know that these movies were going to be horror fests that wouldn't threaten Hitchcock's reputation. The Hitchcock wannabe who was responsible for this disaster was named Stevan Menna. As the title credits aired, we  found out he was the producer, the direcror, writer, and composer. Maybe he did more, but those are the memorable titles. The plot was seemingly a composite of a lot of movies and true crimes. Think of 'The Changeling' with a heavy dose of serial killer Ed Gein thrown into this mix. I don't know if this movie got better as it droned on, but at the point I left I didn't care. A good movie should get its viewer involved, but this didn't.
 Why Did I Get Married too? More like Why did I waste $[...] watching this crap? The real title should be
 I give this movie 1 star it would have gotten half a star but that is not an option.  Tyler Perry's first problem was relying on Janet Jackson to carry the film. She is not the greatest actress in the world and I understand that her brother Michael Jackson died while she made this movie, but still shouldn't have relied on her. Her performance was better in this film than the previous but not by much. In the first film each couple had equal problems and shared equal screen time developing what caused the problems in their marriages. In this film only Patricia/Gavin and Angela/Marcus stories were really developed. The other two couples Troy/Sheila/Mike & Diane/Terry fell flat and not developed like the other two couples.  Angela & Marcus
 At the end of this movie Janet Jackson's character drives her soon to be ex-husband to his death and winds up grinning at the end of the movie as she gazes upon her next sexual prospect. This movie ended like a horror movie. It is a terrible example for any Black women who might be watching. That kind of aggressive, sadistic behavior is what you might read in the news, not in a romantic comedy or drama or whatever this melodrama was supposed to be.   I hope Black women do not watch this movie and think this movie ending was okay because it was quite sinister. The Black men also seem unusually weak while the Black women appear dominant. No man really wants a loud mouthed, dominant woman, no matter what Tyler Perry says. This movie gave me nightmares.
 After watching I can do bad all by myself, I never thought things could get worse but I stand corrected.  Next came the sequel to 'Why did I get married'.  Admittedly, I loved the first movie so I was looking forward to seeing the second and boy was I disappointed.  Key things
 During this film I sat there and began to wonder if TP actually thinks ALL women are like this.  This film really gives African American womem a bad look, NO we are not all loud and bitchy and complaining and upset with our men, being insecure about them. After seeing this film I then looked back at the other movies he made and it seems all the ladies in them have these big hangups and issues about themselves, they enver been loved, then been abused or mistreated or in a previous relationship with some dude who didnt treat them right so now they are just mean to every man that approaches them.  But at the end of the flick he may throw in a Bible verse and all should be well.  When does the movie come out about a happy couple that gets along and makes each other laugh and have some fun.  Relationships are hard and if you want it to work you have to work hard at it.  If not, then leave.  There should be no yelling and cussing and screaming.  I mean grow up already!  Where is the positive, where is the love, I dont see any here, just people not communicating, not supporting each other, accusing each other of stupid stuff and then one big happy ending.  I may have to re-think his films from now on if they re all going to be like this.  In the black community sure we have our issues but not every damn one is like this, some of us are actually happy.
 If you
 Just finished watching it and I was so disappointed.  Too much negative drama. I expected it to have more funny moments and less over the top drama.  The ending was SO DISAPPOINTING!
 Feeble attempt to rip off the first movie. Do not waste your time or money unless you like watching mean-spirited, bitter films.
 I am all for an all black cast, but don't undermine my intelligence by trying feed me crap.  The comedy was non existent, and the drama was horrible.  TP is good, but he missed the boat on this one!  I saw it at the $3 dollar theater 2 weeks after it's release, and even at $3, I think I spent too much!  All my girlfriends who saw it agree.  TP tried to do wayyyyyy to much on this film!
 This movie seemed rushed and so unlike Tyler Perry.  It is truly my least favorite of all of his movies.  I almost walked out of the theater...to me, it was just that bad and there is NO comparing this movie to "Why Did I Get Married". There was no need for a sequel if it was going to be so terrible.
 The plot was totally unrealistic.  What a waste of time.  TP, please don't make a third edition.  A lot of beautiful black people but there was no real character development.  Would not recommend this film.
 The first installment in this series was decent enough to spark my interest in checking out the sequel. Unfortunately, Why Did I Get Married Too was a sub-par attempt to reprise Perry's previous venture in couples therapy. There were a few redeemable aspects of the movie, namely, some of the characters have been further developed. The new aspects of their relationship dynamics made it interesting to see how their lives have changed. Also appreciated are the moments of bare sincerity in the dialogue. There are a few scenes where a husband and wife could be seen having a believable, vulnerable discussion about the impact of individual choices on their relationship without the bravado of over-the-top displays.  Sadly, any redeemable parts of this film were heavily flanked in overwrought dramatic scenes in an effort to create meaningful turning points, and mostly uncomfortable attempts at humor. It's as if Perry thought that hearty laughter from the characters in the more comedic scenes would somehow make the scene funnier; the mission was not accomplished. Also, Perry decided to have the movie be more dependent on Janet Jackson's character as the center pin of the plot, which is an unfortunate shift because she simply doesn't have the skills to deliver. While she is more highly emotive throughout this film, she isn't believable. It just left you feeling uncomfortable watching it happen. To make matters worst, the scene transitions felt abrupt, like you were being yanked by the collar from one end of a room to another.  On a more pitiful note, there were several lines and scenes that were way too close to those from the movies Boomerang, Soul Food, and Unfaithful. It's one thing to have a trite storyline; it's a whole other issue when scenes are taken from other movies and executed so similarly to the original that the forerunner immediately comes to the viewer's mind. This kind of poorly-done mimicry leaves you feeling duped by and embarrassed for the person attempting it. The worst part was the ending, which felt rushed and forced. Perry is certainly invested in happy endings, but this was insulting to the characters and the viewers.  Overall, the only reason I continued to watch the movie was not because it was in any way worth it, but because I have a sometimes silly desire to finish what I've started. I hope that Perry soon decides to employ screenwriters to broaden the scope of what seems to be a one-man show and production because movie scriptwriting requires a level of skill that he has not yet polished.
 Sorry to say I have no idea how this movie is since it is restricted to DVD area 1 and we live in area 2. Pitty beceause we would have loved to see what we paid for.
 only played to chapter 4 and Amazon had to refund me.. booohohoooo. will not buy from them again. did not even respond to my email
 FOR 35 YEARS I HAVE CONSISTENTLY RANKED THIS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.  HAVING SAID THIS, THE VOICES USED TO REPLACE THE ITALIAN AND SPARE THE SUBTITLES STRIP THIS FILM OF ITS BEAUTY RESULTING IN A JUXTAPOSE REMINISCENT OF "WHAT'S UP TIGERLILY?" OR A REVERSAL OF THE PLOTLINE IN "SINGING IN THE RAIN".  GREAT FOR A COMEDY, BUT I DOUBT IT WAS INTENDED BY THE PRODUCERS OF THIS IMMENSE FILM.
 I must have watched a different film than the below reviewers.  I couldn't even get to the end it seemed so disconnected.  When you have to read the jacket cover to figure out what is going on...something is really wrong.  Maybe you have to be a professor to understand this movie but I found it worthless.
 I am so embarrassed to say that I saw this movie. While I admit that there were some funny scenes, overall it was an overly disgusting gross-out. Worse than any other I've ever seen.  Actually, this movie turned me off of gross-out comedies forever. Maybe my IQ isn't low enough to find cruel jokes aimed at gays and the mentally disabled funny. As a 19 year old female I found it to be quite demeaning towards women, but what should I have really expected? As for the people who happily comsume this inane drivel, keep it. I used to love to read, maybe now's a good time to get back to that. Bottom line
 I found this movie to be rather disturbing in its portrait of people in general.  The careless actions of the actors in this movie are some of the contributing factors to the labels that not only African Americans are trying to break free from, but teenagers in general suffer from these sterotypes also.  It is a shame when a movie as sensless as this one was is at the top of society's list of favorites. If this is what people find entertaining then we need to stop complaining the problems in America because we are our own worst enemy!
 This movie was boarderline unwatchable. I'm not one of those people who thinks that stupid equates to funny. I never laughed once at this movie, except maybe when the masked guy calls and says "whassup!?!", but I saw that in the ads anyway.  This isn't the case of people not liking a movie becase it was "too cutting edge" or some stupid [stuff] like that. I laughed myself silly at "Something About Mary", "Road Trip", and the "American Pie" movies. I love "Airplane!" and those other spoofs. But this was not funny! This was just useless [junk]. It was exactly what a couple of 14 year old kids would write if they were ever given the opportunity to write a movie.  It takes a tremendous ammount of talent and intellegence to make a funny "stupid" movie. This is NOT one of those movies. It tries to make up for it's shorcomings by being shocking and gross. It fails miserably, however. It's gross just for the sake of being gross. There's no humor at all in anything that happens. This is the height of useless, gratuitous, garbage. I feel like I wasted 2 prescious hours of my life watching this. Please don't make the same mistake I did.
 I kept waiting. Waiting to laugh. After all, this was supposed to be slapstick. Comedy, right? The only reason that I didn't walk out is because I kept hearing how funny it was. I kept waiting. The laugh never came. My sister and I looked at each other and shook our heads when the credits started rolling.  Was it the worst movie I've ever seen? Possibly. Definitely one of the most disappointing.  And don't you dare say I don't have a sense of humor. I loved the  ;Naked Gun ; series, the  ;Airplane! ; films,  ;Top Secret. ; I'm a big fan of Mike Judge (Beavis &amp; Butt-Head, King Of The Hill, Office Space), and of Comedy Central's South Park series. Take a good look at my DVD List (my  ;home page ; link.) You'll find plenty of comedies there that I'd recommend seeing, and then seeing again and again before renting  ;Scary Movie. ;  Simply said,  ;Scary Movie ; was awful.  Who would enjoy it? Hmm. I don't think I want to know. Seems hypocritical of me to bash someone who might like this film, when I enjoy watching  ;Jackass ; on MTV. I just felt like the writers (that's an insult to writers everywhere) of  ;Scary Movie ; must've gone to a 4th grade class during their recess, got some ideas from them, and then decided to let them write the movie over the next 4 years...
 Let me give a pure, simple, objective evaluation of this movie
 Scary Movie (Keenen Ivory Wayans, 1999)  The tagline to this movie promised  ;no sequel. ; Would that it had been accurate. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this (but then, come to think of it, I had no pateince for mindlessness when I was a teen, either), but I found Scary Movie about as funny as American Pie-- a whole lot of jokes that missed the mark, and those few that found it just didn't appeal to my sense of humor. Besides, why parody a genre of films that's already so mired in self-parody? (zero)
 OK, I'm pretty tolerant of gross entertainment in movies (see my reviews of Road Trip, Me Myself and Irene, and South Park if you don't believe me), TV, books, and music, but Scary Movie is where I draw the line. Why is that? First off, the previews made it seem like a Naked Gun-esque spoof, of which I am a big fan of those types of movies. Yes, it is a spoof like those kinds of movies, but more extreme. Second, after viewing it, I felt like I needed to take a shower because of all the male-organ jokes and gay references(as a straight male, I cannot take too many of those types of jokes). The other problem I had with this movie is it was pretty much the same three jokes written over and over
 I deplored this waste of a perfectly good idea on such a trashy film. Not only was it completely not funny, aside from a handful of good moments that you have already seen on the commercials and trailers, this film has nothing to offer the person coming in for the cheap laugh, or especially for the person coming for a serious gag. Between the good parts, the rest is basically just homophobic filler and will make you want to vomit if you have half an ounce of good taste. The only thing of lower quality than the movie is the DVD. What junk is this? I rented it and couldn't play it on my player on my TV, I had to go to a buddie's house to watch it, and it sucked. Where is the  ;hillarious comedy ; I was promised? Watching this film made me want to hang myself
 My one star rating is for the flawed DVD disc--not the movie.   ;Scary Movie ; is rather crude and vulgar at times, but you can't help but laugh along with it. I--along with many others--seem to be having the same problems with the DVD.  If you play it through a DVD-rom drive, it usually gets hung up on the FBI warning--then it either crashes the DVD player program or the whole computer itself.  I've tried to play it with and without using the PCFriendly program--neither works.  I'm not sure how well it plays on regular DVD players. I've visited PCFriendly's site and looked for support.  They do acknowledge that there have been problems with the DVD getting stuck on the FBI warning, but they insist that it is only a small number of players and not the DVD itself. I have many, many DVDs and have never experienced a problem with any of the titles--except for  ;Scary Movie. ;  I think they just don't want to acknowledge there's a problem and have to risk recalling a bunch of DVDs. Other than all those problems, the film itself is pretty funny.  If anyone has found a solution to these problems, please let us know.
 What a waste of time and money. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it reached video and when I did it was a real let down. How this movie made so much money? Well, I do know, there are more idiots in the world than there have ever been. I did laugh a couple of times, but there was too much emphasis on sex, and was pretty gross at times. None of the class and clever thoughts of the Airplane series or the first Naked Gun. The Wayans tried too hard. Nothing was suttle in this movie. They had to push it down your throat to make you think it was funny. Even my girlfriends brother, who laughs at anything, barely laughed more than 2-3 times. Don't touch this one! Leave it on the shelf!
 Why did this movie get so much hype this summer???? It sucked!!! People said this was the best comedy of the summer, what the hell??!! Road Trip was definetly the best comedy. Scary Movie was nasty and stupid. There was only a few funny parts but not many. I think it should have been rated NC-17. It contained a lot of un-necessasry cursing and nudity. Don't waste your time and money of this terrible movie!
 How could the makers of this film get away with this trash?  The humor is sophomoric and at times disgusting.  The film makers rely on terrible gross out gags for laughs with terrible results.  I can not stand this film. Nobody should be forced to sit through this landfill.
 tedious, regurgitating half digested bits of existing horror movies, this is strictly for morons
 I rated this movie a long time ago.  I don't know what I was thinking when I gave this movie 4 stars.  When I look back I can't believe I liked this movie.  Now when I see it I hate this movie.  I have to re-rate it.  This movie is a piece of trash and is very immature.  A five-year old could write a better script.  It is just a typical gross-out comedy that finds any excuse to put a ... on the screen in order to get a shock out of the viewer.  I am sure that many people who watched it then probably feel the same way about it now.  It isn't even very good at spoofing other movies.  I will not go into detail because it is so simple, it makes fun of teen horror movies.  I am also not going into detail because this movie is a piece of trash for those who think they aren't trash.
 I can't see the movie on DVD.  Same problem as others have had.  It starts with the FBE warning and stays there.  You can't get past it.  Only way out is to eject the DVD unseen.  Stupid.  I've tried 4 copies from Blockbuster and Hollywood Video with same results.  I even tried it on my computer DVD and it hangs up. Somethings wrong here. I going to return the DVD and get the VHS.
 Vulgar, stupid, not funny, and lot of toilet humor. Overall
 The first Scary Movie is just 120 minutes of dumb jokes. Some of which are waaaay too offensive for younger viewers. The second movie is a lot different. Its actually funny! I recomend buying part 2, and go to see part 3 next month in theaters.
 The movie is totally great...  I would buy it... if it would work!  Scary Movie has a defect in it that doens't let it play on some DVD players.  I know JVC, Hitachi, and other DVD players are not able to play this movie...  So do some research and call your DVD player company and see if they are having problems with Scary movie as well.  Hopefully the manufacturers of Scary Movie do a recall as many places have removed the DVD from the shelves because of the high return rate.
 It is in my opinion that this movie was horrible. The purpose of it was to make fun of other horror films but they did not do a good job. In fact it was stupid. Who wants to waist 8 dollars on a movie ticket to see people act like characters they have already seen-- no-one. This movie can be summed up in about two words-- a joke! I give this film 1 star because that is the most it deserves.
 This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It is Sick, Sick, Sick,.  It makes scream I Know what you Did Last Summer look stupid stupid stupid stupid .  The efects are crap crapy crapy.  The must vile movie series ever made. Am buddy who watches this series, is weird, dumb, or a fool.  Don't watch this six movie ug or its sequels.  This movie sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks.  For the love of horrror it sucks.  I hope the people who directed it go bankrupt.  I rather watch dumb Chukey and day  thant this.
 What a waste. A potentially hillarious idea turned into such a waste of film, and now, DVDs. The flick has its moments, like the  ;Whassup ; Scream guy scene, and a couple of others. The trailer for this movie had everybody laughing hard, but when I saw the movie, I discovered that the parts in the trailer were the only parts of the movie that were funny. Everything else had to do with the male organ, sex, or homosexuality, all crudely portrayed. If you have decent taste and you have seen the comercials, there is no reason for you to buy this trash.
 Terrible movie. Raunchy, disgusting. Not even funny. Save your money.
 This movie had been hyped up in OZ, so automatically I was wary, you see they had also done the advertising overkill on a number of disappointments, like MATRIX and the BLAIR WITCH, so why did I go see it? well a movie buff friend of mine gave this a high rating, so on his recomendation I saw it, (much to my eternal regret! ) Now normally I love anything the talented WAYANS family is involved in, (so I guess that was also another reason why I saw SCARY MOVIE) but in this case I wish I had given this flick a miss!   Why didnt I like this 'spoof'? thats easy IT WASNT FUNNY!  People say AMERICAN PIE was juvenile, given that that movie was about juveniles then it was appropriate, which SCARY MOVIE isnt!  I know this is a spoof, using adults playing useless teeny boppers is part of the joke, and the continual reference to the  slasher flicks is the basis of the film, but really lets look at what theyre are trying to make fun of, C'MON SCREAM is the biggest joke there is!  how can anyone make that movie stupider or funnier than it already is!  Ok Ill conceed, some parts were funny in a crude kinda way like the toilet scene with the the sports jock, but that was a cheap laugh, hardly giving us more than a shocked giggle it was seriously lacking in the HA HA category!  Im all for mindless humour but this movie goes way beyond that! To those who havent seen this movie, DONT!  steer clear of this poor attempt at comedy, now if you want to see some truely funny spoofs go get Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Top Secret, Naked Gun(the first one only) and Galaxy Quest, the difference is amazing!
 If you have the regular DVD, do not buy the Blu-ray. It is the worst Blu-Ray DVD I have seen, there is no high def in this transfer. The picture looks digitalized and I was very disapointed with this purchase, don't waste your money on this one.
 If I could use this DVD for toilet paper, at least it would provide some value to me. Because that is where this movie belongs,  ;in the toilet ;. I have never seen a movie that is so filled with insulting and degrading  ;so called ; humor. Parts of it were so bad that I used the fast forward key numerous times. I do not mind R rated movies and I own several that I consider excellent shows. This is not an R rated movie, it should be rated X, but alas they don't have that rating anymore. To anyone who might consider buying this movie, I can give you exact directions to the local landfill where my copy will reside.
 This is one of the worst comedy movies of all time. It seemed like the writers were trying so hard to make it funny, their efforts were way too obvious. It was like the writers were taking a multiple choice test on sophmoric humor. The jokes were not even all that raunchy. I could see that it was funny if you were a) drunk or stoned, b)13 years old, or c)a mental defective. It's better when comedy seems effortless in execution. The Farley Brothers RULE!
 This movie is insulting to people of intelligence everywhere. Not just the horribly rendered jokes, not just the one-note abilities of the Wayans stars (in front of the camera), but in the fact that it tries to pass itself off as being in the tradition of Airplane and The Naked Gun. Gene Siskel once said that sometimes what appears to be stupid is the by product of the efforts of a great number of intelligent people. In short, the cleverness of stupidity as represented by South Park, Beavis and Butthead and Ren and Stimpy. This is none of those things. Which part was funny? The... obsessed boyfriend? The severed head still talking? Every joke is aimed directly at the lowest common denominator. And hey, if that's you, so be it. Oh and lest we forget, the rampant racism and homophobia. The 'pothead losers are funny' message, I could just go on. A movie like this lowers the bar for society.
 Uh yeah it was called SCREAM! So whats the use of parodying a parody? This movie was such a waste, All that gross stuff was unecessary. And how about a CLUE to Hollywood, enough with the gross stuff, its NOT FUNNY! Whatever happened to pure comedy? Stuff that was funny cause it was brilliantly written, and was witty. Go rewatch Liar Liar, or Analyize this. Two movies that didn't lower themselves to the level of trash to be funny. More of that and LESS of these gross out UNFUNNY comedies. If you thought this movie was funny, Get yourselves to Church and Repent! Or go watch Barney, cause that must be your educational level.
 The trailers made the move look absolutely hilarious for one reason
 This one should have been rated R. It's stupid, disgusting and not scary at all. I got to laugh a couple of times and that was it. I value my time at theaters, and movies like this one really upset me.
 There are movies that are funny despite being so crude they can turn your stomach.  The  ;South Park ; film, and  ;There's Something About Mary, ; had lots of big laughs.   ;Scary Movie, ; however, is just tedious.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen most of the good moments. The biggest problems
 Now we all know at this point that Tom Cruise is a little odd and not exactly a brain trust, so it shouldn't be too surprising that he chose to make this awful piece of trash after becoming a pretty big star. But Bryan Browne? The terrific Aussie actor from FX, A Town Like Alice and Breaker Morant? He must have been desperate for cash. Poor guy - He went back to Australia not too long after participating in this hideous venture.  This movie is both unintentionally hilarious at times, and really just plain bad at others. I saw it at the movies with my husband and we both agreed at the time that it was a real stinker. The script is atrocious and completely unrealistic.  If it smells like a bomb and it looks like a bomb, guess what, it's a bomb!  A big smelly bomb. Only watch Cocktail if you've consumed several cocktails yourself!
 This movie is one of those sublimely awful movies that should be savored line by line, wretched moment by wretched moment.  As truly awful as "Plan 9 From Outer Space."  So awful it's terrifying at first, then mesmerizing, then strangely exhilirating--I mean, can people really conceive of something THIS bad?  The "Best Worst" Film of the entire 80s, by a long shot.
 If you don't know what I.Q. is, but if you did, you are sure you could count your's without takeing off more than one shoe ( only if you are sure ) you may enjoy this film.
 As an undergrad I saw this at a free showing on campus and still felt ripped off.  This film had shallow characters, a non-existent plot, and terribly weak acting per dollar required for the stars ( even if it was early in their careers this is the sort of thing that would never have gone to the theaters without a big name to hook to it and if it had been straight to video would have had minimum wage actors, that latter would not have diminished the outcome.)  While the film does touch on some serious human issues, deire for the brass ring, the lure of infidelity, class conflict, ect, it deals with it on a three year old's level of understanding.  Tom goes from being a moronic but ambitious child playing in someone elses sandbox to being a moronic child with his own sandbox and a wife who will flee as soon as she realizes what she has gotten herself into.  Save your brain cells and don't ware out your gag reflex.
 God what a turkey! But it was the 80's afterall.
 Can't remember seeing a movie this bad in, well... ever.  Tom Cruise's Flannagan can't get a job in the biz world, so starts tending bar at what's evidently the world's most swinging TGIF restaurant.  There he meets a shallow, woman-hating bartender named Coughlin who teaches him Coughlin's Laws of How to Treat Women Like Dirt and End Up Pathetic and Alone.  In the end, happily he (Coughlin) dies.  Flanagan, meanwhile, ditches his sweet new girl Elizabeth Shue for some "rich chick" (in his lovable words).  Then he gets bored of the rich chick, finds out he got Elizabeth Shue pregnant, gets spooked by aforementioned pregnancy, kicks a stuffy doorman in the buttocks, proposes to nice pregnant girlfriend, finds out it's gonna be twins, almost gets spooked again but doesn't, recites horrible poetry, and finally tops things off by yelling "The bar is open!" in a high-pitched puberty-like squeal. Yay for happy endings.
 Whatever were they thinking when they dreamed up this one!? What's next, a movie glorifying busboys??
 Why do so many guys like this movie? Vin Diesal is an awful actor! He thinks that good acting is strutting around flexing his big bulging biceps, knocking guys out to prove how big and bad he is. The stunts in this movie were kind of funny to me. Like how he and Paul Walker manage to survive that fall off that cliff jumping off the hood of the car! And how when the bad guys catch them and cuff them to the ceiling Vin Diesal easily breaks out of the cuffs and pounds the dudes to a pulp! Hmm yeah right? Paul Walker is a great actor but he gets easily overshadowed by big bad Vinny! They shouldve gave him a stronger role. Loved The Rock too! He was able to keep his machismo under control. I cant believe they're making a 6! Stop already!
 I left after half way through this movie. Why is everyone scream and fighting each other in this movie? It was like going into a bad high school or a jail cell. Stealing cars and hiding them? Yah right, I'm pretty sure these low-life characters can get away with that. And what chick wouldn't want to get knocked-up by some guy who steals cars for a living, not to mention constantly getting chased by the authority and the Latino "mafia". This is like the Latino Jersey Shore with fast cars. By the way, you combine Brian O'Conner and the Rock character to get the Vin Diesel character. They were all like cry-babies, always dramatizing the situation, no wonder they couldn't get anywhere in life. 1 star because I cannot give it 0 star. I will put on another star because I like fast car, but take off another star because American cars are ugly. So there you have it 1 star for this lovely movie. Save your money, if you want to see fast cars just Youtube it lol.
 I don't know if this movie is good or bad. As soon as I try to play it on my Playstation 3 it locks it up hard and I'm forced to unplug it to shut it down.  I'm forced to rate this at 1 star for being the only brand new DVD I've ever had that won't work on my PS3. I have also made sure to update my PS3 to the latest version.
 I bought this for a friend who likes movies with no plot beyond car crashes, explosions, bullets flying, and women with long hair.  He loved this movie. Say no more. I watched the movie at his house with Wall-O-Sound or whatever it is that blasts the noise at you loudly from all directions. It is used effectively in this movie. It is overused so frequently that I advised him to check his house foundation after the movie.
 By the end of this movie you will be banging your head against the wall.  Here is a breakdown
 should've saved my five bucks and rented transformers. what a stupid, stupid movie. i expected stupid, but i really expected a little more entertainment. boring and retarded.
 On a serious note I wonder how many viewers caught the irony of the immaculate Christ the Redeemer statue over looking one of the world's largest and worst slums. Anyway, the removing of cars from a train scene was entertaining even if not believable whether it was the quick plasma cutting or the 60mph speeding on a dirt trail with holes that would tear a suspension apart even at 5mph while not being torqued in a variety of directions. Yeah, right. Also, falling into water from that height (jumping from the car makes zero difference - same velocity) into water is like falling on to concrete. They also forgot the air bubbles, debris and oil bubbling up from the car. Also, the towing a massive several ton safe around at high speed was entertaining but about as believable as large headed green aliens. The rest of the storyline and wooden stereotypic acting was a rehashed rerun of the genre. Very sleepy-boring.  For well acted creative storyline I recommend watching KickAss, Sucker Punch or Hanna again, instead.
 One of the worst movies i've seen in years. I wish I could have the time spent being bored by it, returned to my life. Definitely Vin Diesel's worst ever. Don't spend any pesos on this piece of crap.
 I was very disappointed with this DVD. I was very excited to watch the Fast Five but when I opened it nothing was on the disc it was blank. So very disappointed!
 I'm glad I only paid 99 cents for this disaster. The only reason I finished it was to see if it would get worse. It did. Anyone over the age of 12 who gave this movie more than two stars needs to finish middle school and high school or get their G.E.D.
 **spoiler alert.  I wanted to like this, but once again a stupid ending ruined an otherwise ok movie. I was even enjoying it a bit and began to think maybe this will be better than 2 through 4, but in the end when they completely defy the laws of physics and have to cars--that might weigh 3000lbs each--that have a combined HP of maybe 1000hp (if tuned) and have a two inch x ten inch tire patch (times four driving tires) pulling a safe that has to be half a million pounds that was built into a building. Not only do they pull it, somehow their mass is enough to whip it like a water skier behind them and smash it through buildings all while going maybe sixty or seventy mph though a city. There is zero chance any two cars in history could have moved that thing an inch...come on people. Really, I know it's just a movie but this is just stupid.  Just stupid.
 I was perorder the combo packaging, because i like the firm Fast Five. but the Bluray disc sfter enter playmovie was no sounds. I don't want just because $20 than spen my time to return, but this was made me mad.
 After watching this movie and seeing the reviews posted here, I hope for the sake of our country that the studios are paying people to post 5 star reviews. This is the worst movie I have seen in decades. I would go through everything that I found jaw dropping stupid about this movie but I need to begin my healing process and try and forget.
 I preordered this movie on sept 24, they said i won't get it until oct 12. Thats to long, should've went to walmart.
 i haven't seen this movie  but i guarantee it doesn't deserve  a 4 and a half rating so just on that i give it 1 out of 5
 This is not a review of the movie. There are enough reviews already on Amazon to decide if you would like to see the actual movie or not. This is a review on the "Extended Version" of this movie. You would have to pay close attention to see where the movie was actually extended. It adds a few frames and  has slight differences that cause the movie to be about 70 seconds longer than the original and only slightly different in some scenes (different angles, etc.). This website shows the differences for each scene---- www (dot) movie-censorship (dot)com/report (dot) php?ID=149783 . It seems to me that the extended version doesn't add much that theatrical version doesn't already have and what is added doesn't seem to make it better.
 There are no logos on the case (like A&E, History Channel, etc) so no one claims to have produced it.  The narrator wasn't identified.  Running time appears to have been overstated.  Low res, low contrast footage that has been seen before.  A small note on the back of the case
 The first 30 minutes of the movie are nearly completely unintelligible.  The camera work and post editing are so fast and disconnected in any discernable manner as to make this mostly unwatchable.  It was like an epileptics worst nightmare.  The story was absurd, the acting terrible, but so much worse was the production.  Avoid.
 You can safely ignore the longer review from the four star reviewer - HE IS THE DIRECTOR of this train wreck and obviously has a financial stake in getting you to watch this. If you are wavering, trying to decide if you will rent this, DON'T. It is shot terribly - horrible angles, terrible lighting, just...atrocious. The dialog and script, plot and pacing - all abysmal. The acting is beyond bad and well and truly into the realm of unwatchable. Even for C-horror (the relatively new genre of shot-on-video-no budget-"backyard" productions that are so prevalent in this age of inexpensive video filmmaking), this one is a waste of time in every aspect. You can very safely ignore the four star rating one review chose to bestow on this. You can also safely ignore the somewhat catchy DVD artwork, which admittedly suckered me in. Just do yourself a giant favor and keep looking - there are many good C-horror movies out there (if you enjoy C-horror). This, as they say, ain't it.
 States that will play on DVD, BLU-RAY & PS3!! Does not fit in ps3 slim had to void ps3 warranty to remove disc does not fit in my Philips DVD player or Sony and Samsung blu-ray players!!!!!
 Universal, for some reason, has elected to continue to produce these double sided disks that contains the Blu-ray movie on one side and the DVD on the flip-side. Why is it that Universal cannot follow in Disney's lead and release these movies as two disk sets. Disney has combo disks that contains the Blu ray and DVD version in the same release, but the DVD and Blu ray disks are on separate disks, utilizing single sided disks.  I seriously do NOT recommend this item for purchase.
 Wow. The other reviewer was right. It's just an imitation of OldBoy. A very bad imitation at that. It's one thing to remake a movie but to copy every single scene is ridiculous. The CGI was bad(the knife in the back. Yup they copied that), the action scenes were bad(they copied the narrow hallway scene but in a wider area);I mean seriously. Who put punching noises in a fight scene. What is the 60s-704? Plus, I heard the director off this movie Is notorious for ripping off other movies and claiming that they're original. I love bollywood movies so I was excited to receive this movie but I am highly disappointed. I had to watch the real OldBoy just to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Don't watch this movie.
 I so desperately wanted this to be a great movie.  I have a tremendous appreciation for what are otherwise considered guilty pleasure horror flicks, i.e,. those that are considered absurd by mainstream, but which I otherwise hesitate to admit my appreciation.  Case in point - Killer Pad, Tequila Body Shots, Hallow's End, etc.  In this case, polynesia may be the only thing that approaches my passion for horror flicks.  Hawaii is by far my absolute favorite place, and so wish the polynesian supper clubs (esp. Kahiki) are as popular now as they were in the 50s.  So with this predisposition, I approached this movie not expecting much but really hoping it would have something redeeming.  Nope.  The absurd plot does not save the c**p production quality, terrible acting, blah blah blah.  Avoid, sadly.
 Be careful ordering this it is from the UK and is in a different format than US. I cant watch it on my player.  Be careful!
 I was unaware that there were "Zone" issues and I couldn't play a UK DVD in Texas. Should've been a clear warning on the selection and not on the package after I bought it.   And I didn't need suggestions to purchase a universal code player!
 The DVD was riddled with pithy comments by the director who is himself a recovering alcoholic. I found these interuptions most annoying since they drowned out the dialogue of the movie.
 The problem with melodramas about alcoholics is that they have a clarity their subject lack.  In 'The Days Of Wine And Roses', a film that repeats all the errors of its famous predecessor, Wilder's 'The Lost Weekend', the various factors that lead Jack Lemmon, and then his wife Lee Remick, to become alcoholics, are clearly illustrated.  He hates the humiliation and pressure of a job where 'public relations officer' is a synonym for 'pimp', and where he has to hustle and lie to market his boss.  He hates himself, and can't face his wife.  He has a social inferiority complex too - his parents were vaudeville performers, not the ideal background for an ambitious executive.  So he drinks.  Because he can't drink alone, he gets his abstemious wife to join him.  He is demoted, and moves to Texas - due to loneliness and the fear of her husband's violent moods, as well as a terror of disappointing a strict father, and possibly because she was a bright career woman reduced to motherhood, she too souses herself.  Director Blake Edwards' camera is often to be found in a god's eye position looking down on his characters, like a judge, or scientist.  By isolating the causes and effects of alcoholism so clearly, the problem can be located, maybe even treated.  Preachy lectures (about not being preachy) and the obligatory Alcoholics Anonymous scene (whose brief is explained at length, as in a public information film) are prominent.  Because Edwards keeps his distance from the characters, we can only look on at them, removed - any joy they personally get from alcohol is made to seem desperate, grotesque and dangerous to us.  Despite the moody photography, the young(ish) stars and the lounge-jazz soundtrack (drowning in moonriverisms), this is the Issue Picture about Alcoholism Stanley Kramer never made. Normally, accuracy in a film never bothers me - the fewer facts clogging up the narrative the better.  But the filmmakers' decision to elucidate or preach has a direct bearing on the movie.  Genuine alcoholism has no clear, direct cause - people usually drift into it imperceptibly for a variety of insignificant,  but accumulative reasons.  There are rarely easily sign-posted, dramatic, 'Meaningful' moments when all is either lost or salvaged.  We never sense with this film the messiness of alcoholism, the smells, the fluids, the desperation, the bleariness, the staleness, the impotence, the shift in outlook or sensibility.  I'm sure the characters feel all these things, but we're not shown them.  Instead, they get to speak Wilder-like epigrams full of irony, word-play, poetic quotations and cogent self-pity.  Remick's decline is signalled by exchanging poetry for cartoons - chucking Ernest Dowson for Tex Avery displays excellent judgement, and the filmmakers' elitist inability to see this suggests what's wrong with 'Roses'.   At the time, Lemmon was applauded for his unexpected dramatic prowess, but his character here is an extension of the neurotic, white-collar executives worn down by the rat-race he always played.  Both he and Remick, despite their best and sincere efforts, are phony approximations or genteel impersonations of drunkenness.  Charles Bickford as Remick's stern father, with his narrow code of decency and integrity, and complete inability to comprehend such crises of modern life that might lead a younger generation to intoxicate themselves for escape, shames them both.
 I can't review an item you haven't sent me yet.
 First off, I have to say that I love this show. So why the 1 star rating? Because this set is not worth it!! I just bought these items individually at about $12 each!!. These 4 seasons come out to about $17 each. I'm trying to save some people money!
 My grandson LOVES Blue's Clues and I paid and downloaded the first episode of this season, only to find that it couldn't be transferred to a DVD for him to watch - so as far as I'm concerned, Amazon Instant Video is a major rip-off.
 I thought this the MOST BORING  movie of all times!  Gag me!  Two great stars, dull movie.
 I loved Angel Heart.  I ordered the unrated (x) version from a seller who works with Amazon.  I received the R rated version. I then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version.  However, it was also rated R.  It looks like I will have to buy it here locally.  The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.  If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version.
 This was one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen.. The main problem being it takes itself seriously at least Piranha was campy and the effects in piranha were cool,these effects were hilarious in a bad way. they used the same under water CGI shark for almost every scene and when the shark was above water it was like a Muppet. The acting was horrible and I couldn't wait for it to end.There were so many miscues such as people being in 3 feet of water and the shark sneaking up on them yet the shark was supposed to be about 30 feet long and it would be sucking air at that depth. Too many more to even mention.Carmen Electra looked like an idiot trying to be extra sexy throwing back her hair and posing every 5 minutes..She's still beautiful but Really ? It's just plain bad and I like cheesy films.this had no cheese appeal it is an epic FAIL.
 I love the O'Connell brothers and Charlie was the only reason I suffered through this piece of crap movie.I know actors have to make a living and most of them are not in the position to pick and choose too much but Charlie should've passed on this one.Horrible acting by all,dumb script,idiotic special effects,Carmen Electra was a joke and what the hell was the director and photographer thinking?The camera was spinning around so much and jumping from one scene to another that it made me nauseous and had to stop the movie every 5 minutes to look away from the TV and take some deep breaths to avoid throwing up.It literally made me sick to watch it.After 30 minutes I couldn't even take it any more,I just fast forwarded to the end.This movie was a complete waste of time and money.I don't know who paid for this movie to be made and put out on Blu-ray but whoever it is,he can write it off on his tax return as a huge loss.
 I'm a big fan of creature features but this one just plain stunk. Most of the things the characters did in the film didn't make any sense and it seemed as if they were just making it up as they went along unscripted. The shark would show up occasionally to liven it up but not enough to keep interest.Carmen electra's character was ridiculous and she spent her time primping and mugging for the camera to look 'sexy'. I think they told her she was the star of the film or something but she was rarely involved.The rest of the cast never rose above typical victim-of-the-quarter hour status. This was more like one of the new National Lampoon films than a creature feature.
 I don't know what the other reviewers have been watching. Luckily, I searched youtube for some excerpts from this concert before buying it, and it is so painful to watch. Shannon Hoon would be dead shortly after this concert, and the reason is quite obvious when looking at this footage. Shannon looks so stoned he can barely stand. His voice sounds accordingly... Poor guy, I felt so sorry for him. I purchased the "Letters from a porcupine" dvd, instead.
 What a terrible DVD. I'm no pessimist, this was recorded horribly. Either Shannon Hoon's voice is awful or the recording was. I suspect it was the latter. I will admit, I'm not a hardcore Blind Melon fan, but I'd downloaded some of their songs like mouth full of cavities et al..and was very impressed. I read the previous reviews and took the gamble of buying the DVD. What a mistake. I also bought Alice in Chains Unplugged which is excellent. If you want to see a grown man wearing makeup and flaling his hands like an octopus while shreeking to the crowd buy this. Otherwise save your money.
 This movie was not what I expected.  I was looking for nostalgia, instead I got different scenes from bugs bunny shows, all of which had nothing to with Easter.  Save your money and do a search on youtube.
 One of the worst zombie films made. As is so often the case with "no budget" films, the film makers had some good ideas, but not enough money to pull them off. Might be real instructive for aspiring film makers. I did not hate it, but don't predict you won't.
 I collect many Blue-Ray concerts... This was the worst and gave it away. I was expecting something better considering the reviews on here.. Guess there are a lot more hard core Dave Mathew groupies than I thought.. I have overlooked bad Video/Audio because the artist did a good job.  I would have been upset if I paid to see this..
 Live at Luther College is amazing. Tim Reynolds expanded my awareness of what an acoustic guitar can do in the hands of a genius with exceeding technical skill; his composition "Stream is mindblowing, as are his solos/riffs on songs like Ants Marching and Tripping Billies. So
 I had to splice out about 30 minutes of crowd noise [applause?] and crude comments by Dave to have a listenable disc.  Dave is talented, unfortuately his ego preceeds all his performances like oobleck seeping everywhere.....
 I bought this tape because the search engine brought it up when I asked for "Song Of The South".  It is just a tape of sing-a-long children songs which includes Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah from Song Of The South.  A good tape if that is what you really wanted.
 ...just exactly how will children learn from our mistakes in the past if people censor them as if they never happened?
 This DVD gives no forwarning of the fact that it has lengthy (approx 2 full minutes) of NON-ANIMATED nudity, featuring a nude woman walking around in an animated room ("Tango"). We are not prudes, we're parents, and it should upset any good parent when their kids are ambushed by porn images. I am glad that my wife and I happened to view this DVD before our little ones did. The only segment which seemed worthwhile is "Creature Comforts", which is really funny (but that segment can be had by buying the DVD which goes by that title). We thought all the other segments were boring, flat, or dumb. We sent it back to Amazon(.com).
 I love City Hunter. But the people selling City Hunter 3 and '91 must have learned selling techniques from drug dealers. I was able to buy the first two seasons of City Hunter, which are like - 52 episodes each, mind you - for between 20 and 30 bucks. Now they want over two hundred dollars for a season that's not even half the usual amount of episodes? And I mean I love that show, but that's ridiculous.
 An obnoxious attempt to make a screwball comedy
 I think this movie is truly a fantasy movie for the women who grew up in trailers in this country.  Which guy in the right mind would actually  give up his career that he worked so hard all his life just for some low-class,broke, uneducated woman that ran into his $70,000 car?  On top of that, this movie portrayed this woman to be a "sweet, innocent" working class girl from Jersey who is not after his money?  Who are they kidding here?
 This movie was equally demeaning to the actors and the audience.  Start with Working Girl, substitute New jersey for Staten Island, then take away the plot, the character development and just about everything else and you're left with the big hair and a plotless love story.  Jamie Gertz has had much better material to work with and Dylan McDermott's primary mode of expression in this role is a lazy smile.  Give the actor some dialogue! The ending was so contrived that there's no reward for sticking with this movie to the end.  You know how it will turn out just from reading the marquis.
 The early 90s were not kind to Eddie Murphy. Paramount butchered Another 48 Hours in the editing room, audiences turned their noses up at Boomerang, and almost nobody even bothered with The Distinguished Gentleman. Eddie had lost his pulling power and decided to go back to the role that made him a superstar. But 1994 just wasn't the right moment as most of the cast and crew were busy, leaving very little in the way of continuity. Several scripts came and went, and what we finally got was a lame 'Die Hard in a Theme Park' story.  There is a huge list of reasons why BHC3 stinks
 The first two films of this trilogy are great. If you have never seen them, I recommend that you go to your local rental store and rent them. As for this one, it's horrible. This is the worst one to me. I hated the theme park story, or was it just the theme park music that was annoying? Anyway, avoid it.
 "Are you going to work with Eddie Murphy again?" Asked to John Landis by someone at the 1992 Fangoria Convention. "I hope not," Landis replied. Now keep in mind this was in reference to them working together in "Coming to America," not this film. I have no idea why they teamed up together again, because the evidence from this film shows they must have really disliked one another even more. Look at this film and then look at "Trading Places," their first collaboration and you can begin to see the differences. I thought with this third "Beverly Hills Cop," Landis was going to support the story adaquately, then for the action scenes show his wild spirit (ala the ending sequences of "Animal House," "American Werewolf," and "Blues Brothers"), and for the comedy, roll two to three cameras and let Eddie play with each scene. If Landis could give Michael Jackson room to do what he wanted in the "Black or White" video, why not let Eddie do what he does best instead of forcing his character and us the audience through a bunch of painfully unfunny scenes, terrible acting, and a tv movie look? Sure it looks better on dvd than it did in the theatres, but that is still no excuse for betraying the core of this series. If it had tried to do something different and been successful, this film would be liked much more. The reason why it is so hated is because the film has no pulse or soul--something I never thought possible for John Landis or Eddie Murphy.  Both men are capable of great things but lord have mercy on this film and give everyone their two hours back.
 Now this is one movie that made me want to get up and leave the movie theater! I regret paying my hard earned money to see this badly put out, predictable, boring plot.
 I can honestly say that this was one of the few times I've ever wanted to walk out of a movie in the theater (my friends prevented me from doing so). Eddie Murphy hadn't made a funny movie in quite a while prior to this, and I remember figuring he was due (besides, how could you mess this up?). But I was wrong... the plot is idiotic, the "action" scenes are childish, and the only two near-giggles are Bronson Pinchot's art dealer, and maybe Hector Elizondo howling "Turn off that !#$*% song!!". Seriously though, the movie's whole premise - Axel getting all choked up over the murder of his boss, who had spent the first two films reaming him out, is both far-fetched and completely out of line with what the series had been. Worse still is the ... family-style veneer (were they trying to attract 5-year-olds by sending Axel to save cartoon characters in a theme park?) The first two movies got great mileage out of skewering 1980's pop-culture and Beverly Hills excess by dropping a rag-tag player from Detroit in the middle and letting him run circles around them. All of that fun is missing here. Action-comedies can be great fun when done well, because humor and danger tend to bounce well off each other. Unfortunately, this film is utterly devoid of either.
 Part 1 and part 2 were great. Whenever a 3rd part comes out or even a 4th and so on I am always skeptical because they usually suck. This movie was no different. Weak plot, boring as heck and the actors are wastedbecause they werent even given good lines. I own a huge collection od DVDs and I own part1 and part 2 and I wouldnt add part 3 if someonegave it to me for free!
 I was going to write my own review of this but I don't think I can improve on what's already here. The movie simply isn't funny. The Axel Foley character is turned from a clever street wise cop always ahead of everyone into this clutz who can't seem to do anything right. The story is about a couterfiet ring operating out of an amusement park. Somehow one of the bad guys shot Inspector Todd (a waste) back in Detroit and Axel is sent again to Beverly Hills. This is one of those movies where the audience can see who the bad guys are from the beginning so there is no suspense here. We are supposed to wait for Foley to unmask the villains and expose the plot. Instead Foley fumbles through scene after scene of ridiculous situations in which he barely escapes except for plain dumb luck. Herein, Axel foley is a clutz who can't get the upper hand here no matter what and is not funny and in no way compares to the first 2 movies in this series. The whole thing feels clumsy and awkward. Reccommend BHC 1 & 2.
 a truly awful film.  the first is my favourite film and the second, although not as good, still gets regular viewings but this is an insult to movie-watchers.  eddie murphy reputedly turned down the role three times due to the atrocious script and eventually only took the part because of the ludicrous amount of money on offer to him.  the absence of john ashton as the perfect foil for judge reinhold is a travesty and his replacement (who's also the bad guy, whoops sorry, spoiled the film, but don't worry, john landis did that for me) is so see-through it is unbelievable.  i urge you not to buy this film.  the first two?  yes.  if you want eddie murphy stuff, go for coming to america or the 48hrs films (not classics, but better than this).  how anyone could say eddie's best role was in bowfinger (see earlier review) beggars belief.  that's an appalling film as well, and possibly eddie's worst ever role.  the first bhc film is his best, just watch the scene at the buffet meal when he says  ;tell victor that ramone, the man he met last week, found out he's got herpesemplex 10 so he better get to the clinic before things start falling off on the brother ; in a camp voice.  genius.
 My family (ages 77, 70, 50, 18, 16, 14, and 44) really enjoyed the first 2 Beverly Hills movies, however the third one only got thumbs up from grandma. It lacked the freshness of the first 2, and was instead a typical cliched sequel. Boring.
 What they tried to say in this movie they could have said in 5 minutes - not spend 1 hour and try to entertain viewers. The actors clearly have no idea who Biblical Israel is and make plain stupid conclusions about Israel in the end time. I am no beginner in "End Time" studies and can appreciate something of value on the subject.  I would like to advise anyone who are into end-time studies to buy the book "Who is Esau-Edom ?". This book is a must read with very well research done by the writer, Charles Weisman. You can buy this book at Amazon.
 over the years this movie has ignorantly used over and over as a tool of evil. there, i said it.  and YES, i absolutely am a christian.  fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom.  the idea of the rapture is less than 200 years old, it was a vision made by a young british woman-> most importantly, THE RAPTURE IS NOT BIBLICAL !!!!!!  this is a weird fear based agenda that has no place in the kingdom.
 Yes, I know, I'm in the minority.  The world loves this movie, and I've never understood why.  I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and the people around me were literally hanging onto their chairs to keep from falling into the aisles laughing.  I never saw anything to even chuckle about as I sat in the streaming cinamatic light and watched them more than the movie, rather in awe....and a bit confused. Okay, the bad guys get burned and hit in the head with a paint can, etc, etc., etc. The courageous little kid wins out. I could root for him, but I failed to see the humor. There are all kinds of humor. This one, obviously, isn't mine. Just wanted to add my 2 cents worth.
 How can we buy this product without knowing the titles?  This happens TOO OFTEN on Amazon!  I might be interested if I knew exactly what I'm purchasing.  Thanks!
 Incredibly bad. 90% of the (very brief) animal scenes weren't even filmed on the same film stock as the rest of the movie! Every time they cut to an animal, suddenly the picture gets all grainy. Can you say, "Stock Footage"? After seeing this turkey you will.  Absolutely typical Disney gotta-have-a-villain story, only watered down beyond belief. This thing doesn't play like a made-for-Disney-Channel quickie, it plays like a BAD made-for-Disney-Channel quickie. If you love your children, don't buy this thing.  If you want to see how the same basic story can be done better without the need for a Disney villian, have a look at the movie "Duma". (Which isn't a great movie, but anything's better than Disney's "Cheetah".)
 received dvd that would not play in my area.  attempting to exchange now for one that will play in louisville ky
 Just on the basis of viewing the 1st 2mins of this version of Get Carter, I would never purchase the DVD.  I've seen the original (UK) version of it, and this ain't it!  Why were Sid Fletcher's and Geralds' voices overdubbed?!?!?!?  God only knows what else was edited and overdubbed!  Charlie Tesoro
 I had little patience with this movie because I thought I was going to see a bit of England.  That's because I didn't know there were two versions both starring or co-starring Michael Caine.  Consequently, as far as I could see it was inexplicably about Americans (apart from Michael Caine), Americans talking to other Americans and driving on the American side of the road with American stop signs.  Why, I thought, would they do that in England, and where were the British scenes?  Finally I realised that I was dealing with a re-make and one perhaps not as good as the original.  Apart from that it was violent and boring.  People smoking cigarettes, indulging in small talk with no brilliance, beating people up, driving recklessly and getting bloodied.  I don't get it. I need to see the 1971 one, unless the script is the same of course.  No actor can, I fear, do much for the plot and dialogue I sampled.
 Bought the DVD with high hopes after reading so many positive reviews....boy, was that a mistake.  Quite a few viewers gave this movie high marks - Why? It wasn't the plot, the acting, the star studded cast, grandiose scenes or special effects....because this movie has little of that. What this movie has is gratuitous nude scenes, a very difficult story line to follow and is just plain hard on the eyes. After having seen the remake of this movie first w/S.Stallone, I wanted the original w/M.Caine to succeed. If you MUST see it, this is one you borrow - not buy. You're going to be disappointed.
 I don't understand it at all. This movie has been universal lauded by critics and the general public alike as a quality film. Well, I think each and every one of these people owe me an apology. This movie is terrible. There is no other way to describe it.  The plot is paper-thin, the flow is stagnant, the characters are weak. The British seem to have a template for making serious-minded crime drama 
 gritty, though it is, this movie is very boring.  caine turns in an ok performance, but the only saving grace of the movie is some quite beautiful nude girls.  other than that, nothing else worth mentioning.  stick with the godfather if you want a good crime movie
 I never got this product.  I recieved an e-mail that mentioned, the product was returned to the whare-house, and my money was re-funded
 Though Henry Morton Robinson's book, on which this film was based, is not the work of a literary giant, its themes (see my review of the novel) were valid and strong. I have no idea what Otto Preminger intended in this film, but the characters and plot of the novel are totally distorted, eliminating the very themes that gave the original merit. Stephen Fermoyle, who Robinson depicts as a dedicated and sincere priest whose downfall is a pride which it takes him many years to recognise, here is reduced to a chilly, stoic figure who seems totally remote. Though the novel also was inclined to excessive dramatics, in the film the very normal exercise of priestly ministry which gave the book some balance is all but gone. Robinson's Stephen frequently needs to confront how his meddling in others' lives has harmed them, particularly in cases where he seems to have  ;solved the problems ; which the others presented. For example, in the book Stephen is crushed by the pain of remembering that his making his sister Mona promise to no longer see her Jewish boyfriend (because it is making the family unhappy) lead to her leaving and ultimately becoming involved with a highly shady character who abandons her during her pregnancy. In the film, since the plot was re-worked so that Mona's fiance decides to convert to Catholicism, then is insulted when Corny Deegan calls him an  ;honorary Irishman ; and leaves Mona, the impact is lost. Rather than seeing Stephen struggle with the raw pain of his meddling, we are given the impression that he hates himself for not allowing a craniotomy on the baby. When Stephen does incorrectly assume he has solved a problem (in the book, with the penitent to whom he refuses absolution, James Splaine and Milky Lyons, to name just three other than the sister whose trust he betrayed), the book makes it clear that Stephen had been perfectly orthodox in the church teachings he presented. The honest message, that orthodoxy without pastoral sensitivity can be devastating rather than helpful, comes through. In the film, one gathers that a cold endurance test is the matter of faith. The entire climax present in the book is equally lost. Robinson's Stephen never leaves the active priesthood nor engages in any sort of love affair. His attraction to a woman (as a  ;would-be Lucifer ; who is only absorbed in what he knows he cannot have, since he never intends to leave his priesthood) is the crucial point in the novel, where Stephen, facing all, sees how pride has dominated his life. The film's  ;leave of absence, ; and apparent consideration of marriage to a pretty student, gives the contrary view - as if he returned to the active ministry as a cold obligation. Since each scene of the film is short and much material missing, the characters have no chance of being developed. It is merely a series of puzzling, often overly dramatic vignettes, as the sphinx-like Cardinal looks on. Overall, this is one of the worst adaptations of a novel which I have seen onscreen.
 After I read the book by Henry Morton Robinson, I couldnt wait to see the film. What a disappointment! I wonder to this day where Preminger got his ideas for the screenplay,and why he eliminated most of Father Fermoyle's family. Although the acting is good, especially, Tom Tryon ,Burgess Meredith and John Houston, there is just no spark to this film. By using flashbacks, Preminger loses what thread of story that is left.  Its too bad that he wasnt even a pinch more faithful to the book,his cast certainly could have handled it. And why oh why were the characters of Gaetano Orselli,Ghislana Falerni, and Roberto Braggioti in particular eliminated.  Did Preminger really think that the character of Anne-Marie would help the plot?? Sorry Otto, that in itself is enough for a big thumbs down. Add it all up and you still get a big waste of time.
 After the successful release of Ray Harryhausen's special effects extravaganza 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD, producer Edward Small decided to clone the idea and hence JACK THE GIANT KILLER was born.   This movie  copied SINBAD's style in every particular, and the result was, while not  nearly as polished as Harryhausen's film, entertaining in its own way.  It  was a major box office disappointment, however, and the studio decided to   ;save ; the movie by RE-EDITING it and ADDING SEVERAL SONGS and a  MUSICAL soundtrack.  This essentially ruined the movie for all but the  kiddies' market. Sadly for collectors, the musical version (recently aired  on Disney Channel) is the one issued on this videotape. I'd hold out for  the original if I were you.
 I am a huge fan of the musical version of this film.  It is so deliciously bad that it completely won me over... I found it completely captivating--I was horror-struck and yet completely fascinated by the songs--a curious concoction of faux-opera (think  ;kill the wabbit ;)--interspersed with the cornball melodrama.  I have no idea why the musical version has fallen into disrepute... the humorless non-musical version will bore you to tears--it is no fun at all.  Until they release the MOST EXCELLENT musical version of this film, do not buy this!
 I grew up and loved the musical version of this film as shown on the disney channel.  I was disappointed to learn that only the dry and humorless version has been released on dvd.  The masters at GoodTimes DVD made a crippling mistake and failed miserably by not making this version the musical version.  This version of the movie is not worth the mere $4.95 that it costs here.  The layer that the music adds is priceless...I watched the musical version of the movie with my girlfriend, and it was like falling in love all over again.  You don't get that feeling from the original version. I'm planning on doing my own transfer of the musical version from VHS to DVD (for personal uses only, sorry guys, you're just going to have to wait until they come out with the musical version.  I bet you're jealous.)  I'm also going to add a special feature that will allow me to loop the songs over and over again, and I'll be singing  ;a spectacle ; until the wee hours of the morning.  Non-musical version=1 star.  Musical-version=5 stars.
 How utterly disapointing... I had no idea that there was a non-musical version of Jack The Giant Killer.  Terrible acting, awful costumes, lame plot,  without the songs this movie is a drabby bore.  The goofy songs are the key to this otherwise DULL movie.
 "Shock Labyrinth" really only has it's boffo title and packaging going for it. Everything else about the movie fails to deliver.  The plot...well, apparently a group of friends visit a spooky fairground attraction as children and there is some kind of accident in which one of the girls vanishes. Then, 10 or so years later the same friends find themselves tricked into going to an abandoned hospital, which then turns into the same funhouse from their past, and they re-live the frightening experience all over again, possibly as part of the twisted revenge of the missing/dead girl.  That might have worked as a plot, in fact on paper it looks pretty good, but watching this movie is absolutely no fun at all. There is but a single key event in the movie, which is that somebody falls over the handrail and down the well of a spiral staircase. Believe it or not, the whole film is constructed to dwell on this one event in as many ways as it is possible. First we see the original accident, then we see it again from another view, then we see other characters go through the same event either as witnesses or as victims themselves, sometimes in their childhood and sometimes in their adult states. The film thinks it's clever in mixing the evens of the past with the present, but it doesn't hold any suspense whatsoever, it just looks like a bunch of kids running in circles and then a bunch of adults running in circles again. The so-called shocks of the labyrinth are provided by (wait for it) a white toy bunny and a yellow balloon with a smiling bumble bee on it. Shots of the bunny in particular are wheeled out interminably, not that a single shot of it provokes any feelings of fear whatsoever. At no point in the film does anything approaching scary happen. Not in one single minute of it, and therefore I count "Shock Labyrinth" as a total failure to entertain.  By the way, you might pick up the DVD that comes with both 3D and 2D versions, but if you think the 3D will rescue it, think again. It's totally unwatchable, I only lasted about 1.5 minutes before yanking off the 3D specs and sticking the 2D version on.  What a shame.
 The costumes and sets aren't too bad, but otherwise this looks like a bad TV movie from the 70s usually does. I agree that there is less of the melodrama than in Cecil DeMille's film, but the writing and acting are still painful to watch, and the picture is always dark. It must be that people feel nostalgic about something from years gone by, because this movie looks so very bad compared to classics of the past and modern filmmaking.
 Great actor, absolutely terrible movie. So bad that it is almost funny.
 I have hit an all-time low.  I have rebooted my film lifestyle.  Prior to watching "Inspector Gadget 2", I was willing and absolutely able to watching anything that came through the system.  I was up for any low-budget feature, no matter what country of origin, I was up for good, the bad, and the ugly, AND I was even up for those direct-to-home features that make nearly every cineophile shudder.  This was my life, up until about a week ago.  I found myself trudging through both "Inspector Gadget as well as the cartoon voiced by Don Adams, and the direct-to-Disney sequel, "Inspector Gadget 2".  It was after this viewing that I eliminated all the upcoming films in my list, opened a fresh page, and started from scratch.  I am going to begin (after I finish watching "The Longest Yard remake and original) watching more classic, foreign, and contemporary independent films.  I want to bring the level of control back and impress those with more of a knowledge than whom was a better Inspector Gadget, Mathew Broderick or French Stewart - alas, friends, I do know the answer to that, and I am not proud enough to shout it on the highest mountain.  It is embarrassing that I have to nominate one "Inspector Gadget film over the other, but a critics work is never done.  I have no favorite when it comes to this franchise, I have no favorite when it comes to stories that completely demolish the structure of the cartoon of which it is based.  In closing, I have no favorite at all when you have two films that are only connected by the titles they share.  "Inspector Gadget 2 is possibly one of the worst sequels to dawn the direct-to-DVD call tag at the bottom of the box.  Using nothings from the original film (not the same characters, not the same style, not the same comic timing), this film is one that you have to watch alone, not standing right next to the original Broderick vehicle.  French Stewart (he is always squinting ... why?), with the aid of director Alex Zamm try to bring the original concept back the the series without any known budget.  Stewart brings a new Inspector to the film, a more arrogant, snobbish, seems to be tormented by life, protagonist that cares nothing for those surrounding him.  He is a character that we cannot love, no matter how many times we have to sit through one viewing of this film.  What is interesting about Stewart is that he is actually closer to the the animated Gadget than the original.  Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original - but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two.  Claw used to always monitor Gadget's doings, in this one, there seems to be a haphazard care as to what either is doing.  Penny still doesn't have her book and Brain still isn't getting anyone out of trouble.  Where is the consistency here?  Too add to the mix, we are introduced to a new character "G2", the newest upgrade to the Gadget line.  Like anything this riddled with clich&eacute;s, there is an initial problem with the two of them, but eventually a spark misfires and Gadget is introduced to yet another love interest.  Considering the problems anatomically with this couple, there is no further spark between them.  The only reason the two are put in a this film are to be together, not for any other purpose.  There is no sense of individualism, just flimsy cause followed by an effect that could have been predicted before the opening credits ended.  "Inspector Gadget 2 has not seen the best reviews, nor will it get a good one from me - it tried, but ultimately it failed.  There was no purpose to create this erroneous sequel.  Disney was hoping to cash in on the Broderick fan base, the younger generation that knows no better , or just to make some extra dollars to pad their bottom line, but there was no reason to resurrect this already problematic series.  I hated Elaine Hendrix's mesh between "Robocop and "Judge Dredd".  She was funny at parts that were not meant to be funny, and chokingly bad at parts that were meant to draw sympathy from the audience.  Perhaps it was the writing, or the campy way that it was filmed, or the cheesy ploy to get audiences to laugh, but this sequel just left me out to dry.  If I had to speak positively about this film in any way, I would have to comment on the CGI which did improve a bit with this lower-budget film.  I thought the idea of "freezing-time was a fun concept equal to what Claw would do, but again, we seemed to lack the spunk and originality of the cartoon.  I would never consider this franchise a remake of the cartoon, but instead their own unoriginal spin-off.  I blame Disney a bit for this film because cutting corners and cost is not an excuse for making poor films.  If Broderick or even the horrid Everett could not reprise their roles for this sequel, it should have just stopped there.  Don't push a circular peg into a square hole, but instead we continued to push and found cheap replacements for the original.  This is a very kid friendly moment that if I were 3, would probably find visually entertaining, but from a company that prides itself on making Oscar-worthy animation, I expect a higher level of distrobution.  French Stewart should stop working while he still is remembered for his humorous work on "Third Rock from the Sun", while the rest of this cast shouldn't even bother with another feature.  I think it is bad enough that they couldn't even get Cheri Oteri back, cause, you know, she's expensive.  Overall, I have to say that "Inspector Gadget 2 is a blunderment of a film, and the one star review that I am giving it is generous.  There is no need for these types of films to enter into mainstream cinema.  It dulls the senses for those hoping to find engrossing cinema out there, and proves that a mind isn't necessary to watch French in action.  As a cinematic community, we have to put a stop to this.  Zamm attempted to retain some of the originality of the cartoon, but couldn't compile a cast good enough to bring the humor, form, grace, and talent of the animated series to light.  There was no chemistry between anyone, and when the clich&eacute;s began to cause a horrid avalanche, I was caught with nowhere to hide.  As I attempt to think of another film that likens to how poor this film was, nothing comes to mind.  So, with that said, I have restarted.  You will see me soon reviewing better films where my mind can be used, instead of trash like this were jell-o sliding on a stick would be more entertaining.  If I had to end with a thought in mind, it would be this - Claw never showed his face, this can be learned from watching the pilot "Inspector Gadget where he had a mustache, so you shouldn't be able to see his face in the films.  It is simple.  It would be like creating the Smurfs live-action where they were a shade of orange instead of blue.  You just don't do it.  So, when it comes to this film - just don't do it.  You will be happier, and no so bitter like myself.  Grade
 this movie stinks i strongly dislike it what makes me wanna hate this movie even more is that french stewart is in it this movie stinks french stewart is one lousy lazy actor this movie stinks do not waste your money on this terrible movie buy something else instead
 A little known tidbit about the history of Philadelphia
 This is even worse then the first. It makes zero sense. The Jokes are even more cornier and cheesier. The acting is really bad as the acting from The Room. French Stewart(Who replaced Matthew Brodrick in this film) is even a worse actor then Matthew. The Plot is is your very cliche "Villain wants revenge" story. The G2 woman is nothing then a female counterpart to our male hero. I will give the movie credit for hiding Dr.Claw's face this time even though it was pointless now that we know what he looks like. I give this film a 1 out of 10.
 A very confused movie.  It meanders through its first eighty-minute Act and then gets nonsensical and just winds down in its last ten minutes.  Is the coda supposed to be a searing indictment of live-action roleplaying?  Is such an indictment really necessary?  Tonally, the movie is profoundly confused and doesn't know what it wants to be. Story-wise it's illogical and really asks the viewer to abandon any real investment in the very world its trying to create.  Aesthetically it's blue-on-blue-on-black flat.  There's a single character of interest but the movie fails to successfully explore him (and the moviemakers ignore a great conflict between estranged brothers that could've been the lynchpin of a spectacular action/comedy).  Ultimately there aren't any valuable characters; I don't know who these people are, what they're really fighting for or why I should care.  An impressive effort for a budget of $500k, is what we're all supposed to say about this movie, but it fails in nearly every department.  It generally lacks heart, eschews tremendous opportunities for story, characters, humor and excitement throughout its incredibly-long first act, degenerates into nonsensical gore in the last few minutes and then just sort drops off the face of the earth.  A great concept given an abysmal treatment.  I did, however, make a spectacular stew while I was watching it.  So, there's that.
 Amazon's ad shows the Classic 1930 version of ALL IS QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, they sent the much later version with John Boy from the Walton's. It is a poor version and not worth the materials used to make it. Having Amazon involved with the deal we assumed we would have NO PROBLEMS. That was our first mistake, these were to be gifts and now we have no gifts because the wrong movie was sent and Amazon is still showing the wrong version on this ad. Even this review page shows the Classic 1930 MOVIE AND NOT THE ONE THAT THEY ARE SENDING OUT. BEWARE AND ASK OR CALL TO CONFIRM YOU ARE GETTING THE RIGHT MOVIE.
 Received DVD fairly quickly; however the DVD has several damaged places on it that would not play and I had a hard time getting past them.  I would have returned it, but I had already thrown the packaging away.
 If you are looking for a good movie to watch at bedtime about a bunch of doctors walking around a hospital, then this movie is for you. Thats basically all that happens in this movie; NOTHING. If you watch this movie, here is what you will get - Sleepy
 Let me start off by saying I love horror movies...especially zombie flix.  I have seen many good and even more bad horror movies, and often times I can appeiate the ones that are so great.  There is usually some entertainment value.  I have to say this is the worst zombie movie I have ever seen, and one of the worst movies.  It was so boring; the acting was aweful; they threw things in that made no sense {random girl/girl kiss for example). I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. The only excitement was in the last few minuts, but it was so bad that you would just be excited it was almost over (that is if you made it this far). There was not even a minimal level of enjoyment...and I can usually find something to appreciate in most movies.
 I have to believe the positive reviews on this are fake... poor acting - low budget (which can still work but, not in this case) no zombies till last 15 minutes... weak... and I love zombie flicks... but, certainly not this one...
 I rented this film but did not have time to watch, but as soon as I am able to see it will review it. It has got some descent reviews since its release.
 This had to be the worst movie i have ever watched.  EVER!!!!  Don't waste your time renting or buying it.
 This video was disappointing.  The 52-53 minute duration is an exercise in agony.  The video itself is difficult to watch due to the excessive glare and shadow.  With the exception of the charter guide's opening  demonstration of trolling to net bait and his explanation of fishing on a  changing tide there is little else to learn.  The two fishermen in the  video are poor informers, demonstrators and are just unpleasant company on  this trip. Should you ever find yourself in a boat with them, check your  GPS and you'll find you are in the 4th level of hell.  The second part of  the video features a  ;lady angler. ;  Seasoned female fishermen  will find her stereotypical if not insulting.  This video is a wash.  I own  many fishing videos from Amazon.com.  I have never received one that I  wanted my money back.  This one I would like a refund and an apology. This  is my second attempt to warn customers of this video.  Amazon must have  found my first review too scathing.
 This video is so bad it is painful to even remember it for your review.  I provide this review as a duty to fellow fishermen and for you to save the cost of this title.   The quality of the video is poor.  The glare and  shadow prevent you from identifying the fish, the type bait, the tackle,  the fishing conditions, etc.  Forget any hope of a demonstration of rigs,  techniques, etc.  In fact, it is my opinion that this video is almost  completely devoid of any useful information or entertainment value.  The  52-53 minute video is divided into two parts. Part One finds the charter  captain and two customers, Jim and Howard, on the waters of the Gulf.  The  charter captain seems competent enough and his very brief demonstration of  bait fish collection with a trolled net and his brief discussion of tide  changes when fishing a pass are, perhaps, the only useful tips.  Sadly, you  will rarely hear from him.  Instead you are inundated with Jim's (Jed  Clampett with Stooge's Larry haircut) constant drivel.  Jim presents as  a  selfish, irritating man who treats grinnin' Howard like an unemployed,  idiot son-in-law. Jim imparts no fishing knowledge that I could discern and  will not shut up.  I could not fish with such a man and would seriously  entertain thoughts of pushing him from the boat.  You cannot even enjoy  this video on mute.   Part Two introduces you to  ;Lady Angler - Kate  Jackson.   Deceptively not the Angel and Angler is a real stretch.  She does not make any meaningful  contribution to this video.  I believe women anglers will find her  insulting and sterotypical.  She squeals when the fish pull, has no fishing  rod technique, complains of how hard it is to reel in her fish, and has on  far too many clothes to even be a pleasant diversion.  I know  people who  fish to avoid such irritating companionship. I would prefer to have the  dentist perform a root canal without an anesthetic than to see the cover of  this video, much less watch it.  Do Not waste your money.
 I dont mean to be so negative but I'm a business person and I dont have the time or energy to send this back and im annoyed. I was looking for  some good educational  information and this was a joke.  This is an outdated  video of three guys catching fish and complementing each other.  No tackle discussions, no  bait discussion.  I am frankly floored this is even being sold.  A guide to  saltwater fishing should take you through tackle, bait, techiniques, locations, tips.  I have 5 other videos of the series and I hope they are produced with education in mind.
 I always try to get reviews from amazon first before I buy anything on the internet,but last week I was surfing around and found a site that offered this video and bought it becuse I had heard of bennett marine videos in the past. what have I done was my first thought as I squinted into the tv screen trying to make out what was happening in the very poorly focused scenes. I still dont know what they were using for bait or any other relavent information you would expect from a guide on saltwater  fishing video. This video was absolutely the sorriest excuse for an informative video I could have ever imagined!!HOW DARE ANYONE CALL IT A GUIDE Its just an old home video of a weak fishing trip with three guys and a whining woman in the late seventies or early eighties at best. unfortunatly I found its reviews here after the fact. Stick to the saturday morning fishing shows and you will be 1000 times more informed. I would recomend high-hook videos for anyone looking to learn the proper way to fish or rig they are worth every penny. once again I learn the hard way.......
 At first I was so excited to order this because I have heard so much about Tina Landon was eager to give this a try.  I found it so difficult to keep up with Tina you basically need to have some sort of training in choreography to understand how to do some of the moves.  It is a little cheesy at times &amp; I feel that she teaches a little too fast and doesn't break down the moves well enough to understand them.  As the titles indicates, this is session 1 and after giving this a try (twice!) there is no way I am interested in a session 2! Save your money, unless of course you've had some form of professional training.  Too bad that Amazon doesn't offer a video preview so you can see for yourselves.  Some of the dance portions she breaks down are from Jennifer Lopez's  ;If you had my love ; video, Christina Aguilera's  ;Come on over ; Shakira's  ;Wherever, whenever ; video, Britney Spears'  ;Oops I did it again ; and one by Samantha Mumba.
 Mary Poppins is one of my all-time favorites. Is fantastic film that is perfect in every way. the actors are excellent, the animation superb and the songs are unique. five years ago, Disney released a 40th Anniversary Edition DVD with 2 discs. It was one of the best DVDs editions that Disney had released with everything that we need to know about the movie besides the fantastic restoration of the film.  This January, Disney released a 45th Anniversary Edition. While some people like me will think that was too soon for another re-release, Disney as usual, wants to gain more profits. This new DVD has the same picture and sound than the original. Nothing is shinier, crispier or anything. Is exactly the same. Disc one holds the same bonus material as the 40th Ann. Ed. Disc Two presents us Disney on Broadway, a bunch of featurettes that shows us the new Mary Poppins musical. This is completely a waste. We are concern about the movie itself not the musical so this is unnecessary. The other bonus materials are the same that the ones in the 40 Ann Ed. But, in order to put this Broadway featurerette, Disney dropped some good material about the movie that are encountered on the previous DVD. This material is
 This is a 5-star movie crammed into a 1-star DVD. If you're renting a movie, you only plan on seeing it once... when you buy a movie, you have bought the right to see it whenever you please for as long as you want.  This DVD has FORCED COMMERCIALS! You can not skip them and you are forced to fast-forward through them.  Instead of endearing you to the movies featured in the trailers, you eventually get so mad that the thought of those films makes your blood boil... especially if you already have purchased those films on DVD and you don't need to be coerced into buying them in the first place. There is no excuse for this. Disney should offer refunds and/or replacement discs to those who purchased them on good faith. In addition to the forced commercials, the tech specs are misleading and plain wrong. While the film is widescreen, it is NOT anamorphic as is claimed... this means that while it is in letterbox format, it is not in proper proportion and the images are slightly distorted. Just throwing a movie on a round disk does not a DVD make and this is proof.  The movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings... but as the title of this review states - this is a DVD review, not the film. I'd advise waiting until a collector's edition comes out. A collector's edition is likely to contain more features such as interviews with the cast, out-takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year... and (one can only pray) no forced commercials.
 I am unable to play this Mary Poppins DVD as it is not for my region and will not play. My grandchildren were extremely disappointed and I felt I had been duped.  I think Amazon should send me a replacement that will play in Australia. I have bought before and always been happy, but will hesitate before I buy from Amazon again.
 The online streamed version of this movie is NOT widescreen. It is pan & scan and looks like a low-quality YouTube video circa 2003. I did a bandwidth speedtest showing 10 Mbps download but Amazon's video connect shows 1 of 5 bars, so their video server cannot handle decent quality video. Refund please.
 I guess you get what you pay for.  Only $2 plus another $2-3 for shipping.  It's a DVD for the UK or Ireland.  It's printed in tiny letters on the DVD.  I obviously thought I was buying a DVD for the U.S. Bummer
 P.L. Travers rightfully objected to the way Disney's team ruined Mary Poppins' character.  It was bad enough to turn it into a musical--the "real" Mary Poppins never sang--but adding cartoons??  Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest.  I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old.  I agree with another reviewer--this is one of Disney's worst movies ever.  [...]
 This is without a doubt the WORST informational dvd ever! The seller was great though, they refunded 20% of the purchase price.
 This cartoon was recorded in ep mode and is so badly done that you can hardly watch it.  It is such a shame that the people who made this tape are so cheap that they couldn't have used a better viewing mode.
 Although these are ok pilates moves, this is not a challenging workout.  I don't think this offers anything over standard pilates DVDs and is a bit slower than the ones I already own.
 While I don't condone people stealing their content, decisions by backward thinking organizations like MLB all but assure that people are going to.  Putting out non-HD content in this day and age is like putting out black and white videos in 1980.  Whoever wants to buy this content wants it in BluRay HD, not DVD.  So these people are going to steal it off the internet to get it in the format that they want because MLB won't provide it.  I truly believe most of these people would pay for it if MLB offered it.  But since they don't, MLB loses money.  Again, I don't condone stealing your content, but I also don't condone paying for this content since it is in a near-defunct format.  Save your money until MLB gets their act together and puts it out in a modern format.
 I don't see why the most recent World Series can't be put on Blu-Ray and watched/enjoyed in High Def. I can understand the 1985 or 1979 World Series being DVD only. But with every World Series I've seen since I got an HD TV in 2005 being broadcast in HD, I see absolutely no reason to continue to sell an inferior product like this when better stuff is available.  Personally, I don't like the Cardinals and found Game 6 to be the single worst sports moment since Cabrera and Bream beat the Pirates in 1992. But I think the fans of the Cardinals should be able to enjoy watching the game for years to come in HD. Not an old, out of date format.
 I have watched the movie long time ago, and i enjoyed every moment of it, i was so glad i found it in amazon but when i ordered i was shocked to find that the box was simply empty! where was the DVD?!! i am so disappointed.
 I was extremely disappointed with this DVD and subsequently returned it.  One would hope that an instructional DVD would cover topics such as how to surf cast which is more difficult to learn from a book that can only present a sequence of photographs.  Instead the information covered is actually better presented in Burnley's "Surf Fishing the Atlantic Coast".  Information on how to identify good fishing spots and the equipment to use doesn't require a video format for effective presentation.  The only action in the DVD are scenes of good ol' boys fishing the Carolina Coast--it was more of a travelogue from the fifties than an instructional video.  Save your money.
 Most of this is filmed right on the beach with the wind blowing into the mic.  You can't understand about 90% of what they're saying!  Very low quality/amateur. - don't bother.

 Did I mention the fact that this is a Boring movie.I drank 7 beers and watched this movie.Thinking it had potential since it's about satanism and the like.Also it was suppost to have nudity in it but it didn't,at least my copy didn't.It appeared to have had 3 differant scipts of the movie piced together resulting in a big mess.Nothing scary or exciting here except a big waste of your time.
 Dumb movie about your typical Cult(cults suck) and a bunch of naive idiot followers,sadly this topic has been done ad-infinity,Cult movies are the worse.
 This version of the movie is from "RHINO" and is edited not full version of the movie. So unfortanately I have to say I did not enjoy the movie at all
 I just finished wasting 80 minutes watching this "fright" flick.  It has some nice shots of NYC, but that's about it.  On a scale of 1 - 10,  Skin shown - 1  Horror - 1  Credibility - 1  Acting - 1  I expect a demonic horror film to be frightening, tense, and have some clever twists.  This had none.  The only erotic shot (nothing sexy in the dvd)is on the COVER of the dvd.  The villains were able to kill off a half dozen people without anyone investigating, and apparently no neighbors noticed.  In one scene the boring bad-guy carries a young woman out of a gym wrapped in a sheet without anyone questioning him.  DUM  DUM  MUD  DUM  DUM
 Before you buy anything from Teaching Systems ensure whether it is available in standard Deviants.  The Standard Deviants prices are cheaper compared to Teaching Systems, though the products are one and the same.
 It's funny cause it's true.  When I bought this film there was only two existing reviews, and both of those reviewers had rated it 5 stars and where raving about it. I thought that maybe this might be a modern exploitation gem. A day or so after I had already purchased the feature online I noticed that the 5 star rating that it once had, had suddenly and dramatically dropped sharply. Now there was four reviews about this film, only now these next two reviewers where rating it 1 star and warning people to stay away from it, while calling it a peice of dreck. If only I had waited an extra day or two, then I might of done the smart thing and researched this film a bit further before I committed to buying it. Still, it is pretty funny when you make a mistake of this kind in which there is a lesson to be learned about being too impulsive. Now I found myself stuck waiting for this product to arrive on my doorstep just to see which set of reviewers where going to be right. I guess at the very least, there was still some hope remaining at this point. Well, I'm very sad to report to you, that all that remaining hope had melted away like a glob of icecream in a hot gutter, once the DVD did arrive, and I put it in the tray and pushed play.  What I will never understand about modern low budget exploitation movie makers is their complete utter lack of common sense. It just seems so obvious to me that if you want to make an exploitation film that actually works, and you don't have much of a budget or a professional production team backing you up, then you need to keep the story as concise and simple as possible. Some zany screw ball idea about some duel sexed wacky door to door demon with a huge wee wee that rapes MEN in the rear end over a pop song sound track, is only good for pointing your finger at and teasing. Worse still, is the waiting in between these corny assaults. It is then that you are stuck listening to the banter of a pack of unlikable next victim idiots who can't act, and are reading the dialogue of a person who can't write. This film doesn't fallow a blue print for success, it only fallows a blue print to expose every single weakness of its amateur production team.  Shades of Evil Dead and The Shining. No shades of glory.  Basically you have these young med students who horse play with a bad drug and this evil arcane taped hypnosis session that one of them had found in some corner of the med school warehouse. This taped session is like the translation tapes in Evil Dead that invoke demons when you play it. In this case, a mad doctor seemed to have accidentally conjured up Satan and got two of his patients, ( a man and a women ) possessed in the process. At least I think they where patients of his, they sure looked crazy, but it's hard to tell. My mind body and soul where already checked out of this stink bomb by this point. So now, after this arcane taped session gets played, this door to door silly Satan shows up as a naked chick and starts to make out with one of the unlikable male next victim idiots who can't act, and then like the pretty naked woman in room 239 of The Shining who before your eyes, turns into an old fossil covered in pizza cheese, our silly Satan turns into the male mental patient from the said arcane evil tape session, only now he is sporting a giant rubber willy. So, as the silly Satan attacks and chases people down freshly mopped hallways, the director plays one of his personal favorite pop songs as the back ground soundtrack rather then something that would of been actually menacing to back up the action. That's it in a nut shell, that's the high jinks you will be getting if you buy this DVD. A man raping another man like it is some prison shower scene. It's like falling asleep and waking up a moment later only to find yourself in the pokey.  The question is, now that I own this DVD, what do I use if for. I sure as heck won't be watching it again. I suppose if I find a short leg on a piece of furnature in my house, I can use this DVD to prop it up and even it out. Then again, this DVD is so absolutely wretched that maybe I should just break out the saw and get it over with by shorting a leg on something myself. I can always do what I did with the Sick Girl DVD that I wanted to get rid of last year, and stuff it into one of my coworkers stockings at Christmas time. The problem with that idea is, is that I don't know anyone who's been naughty enough all year round to deserve having to sit through this monstrosity. Maybe I will take the title of this DVD to heart, and turn it into a ninja star just in case someone creepy ends up knocking on my door. All I can tell you is that if you want to see a low budget oddity that is actually a good watch, then get a copy of Evil Aliens. And if you want to get a modern grizzly low budget exploitation shocker that doesn't mess around and delivers the goods, then find yourself the South American gem I'll Never Die Alone. If you do anything else in life, stay clear of this loser, it's not worth the price of the disc that it's printed on. This has been a Krakatoa 1883 public service announcement.
 This falls into the "rubber reality" category which I tend to like. "The Machinist", "The Jacket" and "Stay" are amongst my favorite movies, but this outing is terrible. It is one of the ugliest, most stupid, most mean spirited movies I've ever seen. Had it clocked in at one second more than its 78 minute running time I might have ended up sticking knitting needles through my eyes.  The story revolves around a close knit group of college students. All but one takes a particular drug used in some infamous psychology experiment that went south. Weird things happen and people start dieing.  This is gruesome and depraved. These are some of the most unlikeable people I've ever seen in film. Why would anyone want to watch a movie where only one character is even mildly likable. They are almost all terrible actors as well. The one actor playing Sebastian is the best of the bunch but he's such a disgusting individual I didn't care. And then there's Vernon Wells. He was one of the chief bad guys in "Road Warrior". Now, when he's your "draw" name in a movie, and you can only afford him for two scenes, you know you're in deep kimchi.   Unless you're an extreme masochist I wouldn't bother with this one.
 Please, Please listen to me, this movie promises everything and delivers absolutely NOTHING, if you want to be bored to tears and cry because you were tricked into buying this movie by a company that peddles out crap and calls it a movie as I was, then make the same mistake I did. I simply cannot believe how deeply disappointed I was in this ( MOVIE ? ). If i ever see another movie with " a film by Chad Ferrin, you can bet your butt i won't be tricked again, or the words  " Vicious Circle Films. Seriously they advertised " Graphic sex " there was absolutely NOT one scene that was " Graphic Sex " If you want to watch someone with an obvious strap-on that was his mutant penis chase someone down a hallway then ignore my warnings and buy this piece of dreck. The only review i can give this movie is it's a terrible waste of time and money. I'm hard pressed to give it one star. Oh yes Breakingglasspictures.com had it's name on it too, beware the lies and hype, oh wait, there was one or two scenes of full frontal female nudity. I always look for some redeeming value in a movie this one has 0% redeeming value!!!
 Its funny just beacuase a director puts out a film that everyone in the genre loves (Easter bunny kill kill) then they think all of a sudden the guys a genius and everything he does is gold, I thought easter bunny was ok but it wasnt great, and it sickens me that directors like this get so much praise, i mean this movies about a mutated penis creature that haunts dreams it has no class, you may like this movie if you like penis..? but as a horror fan raised on Vincent price ect id appreciate that if someone is to be praised i dont have to see monster peninses in their films..This is John waters class.
 Holly Mother of Mitra is this a big steaming pile of drug induced excrement or what? How I set through this is beyond me, I just keep thinking it would get better, after all there is plenty of sex and gore and more sex you don't want to see all mixed up in a big sorry pitiful excuse for a movie. Save your time or fast forward to the good parts because this movie sucks.
 Dont believe the hype. As a person who has always been bored with mainstream entertainment. I've always sought out taboo subjects and titles. THIS is just garbage,plain and simple. A bunch of idiots running around,tryin to make something out of nothing. Kinda reminds me of another wasteful title..."The heart is deceitful above all things". If your really looking for something,"out there",thats actually gonna take you for a ride that you'll probably remember for the rest of your life. I totally recommend
 Too bad there are no ZERO stars.. This "thing would get it.  OK, Parker WAS working for Elvis and so on.  But apart from that, which is extremely minor, WHAT is this thing doing under "Elvis Presley when you search for new Elvis Presley DVD's?  Amazon sure had a strange way to put things together.  Go ahead try it
 I just bought this film on the recommendation of a friend. It is, by far, one of the most annoying films I?ve ever seen. Basically you get five guys yelling for two hours. The plot is transparent and the characters two-dimensional. I seldom take time to write a negative review but this movie is just so awful.
 What a horrible mess!  Despite a great cast, a great premise and a first-time, promising director, the movie fails miserably to succeed. It's like a terrible, missguided experiment in black humor.  Those in search for  a true black comedy should try Todd Soldonz's  ;Happiness ;.  Those  who think that Christian Slater's role was a good  ;Jack  Nicholson ; imitation, should take a look at  ;Heathers ;, and  those who think Cameron Diaz was truly wicked, should watch  ;The Last  Supper ;.  'Nuff said.
 If you enjoy watching people scream, fight and kill through an entire movie, then you'll love this one.  If not, don't bother.  No redeeming value whatsoever.  I'd give this negative stars if I could.
 that could condone the production and marketing of a film like this. I'm convinced that eveyone who gave this film 4 stars or above also ordered Time Life Books  ;Serial Killers ; for some reading enjoyment on a rainy day. Lets face it, this movie represents a very sick scenario that when it actually does happen in real life, the perpetrators get the death penalty or life in prison. I would like to see the people who laughed through this movie, or proclaimed it as brilliant do the same after it actually happened to a member of their family. You people have way to much time on your hands.
 I dont know why everyoen thinks this movie is so graet. I saw it once and it was about a bunch of idiots who didn't know to kill the idiot who kept teling them to murder people, just becuse he liked that.  The guy who was getting married shouldnt have let hsi friends hire a prostitue, and then, they shouldn't have done drugs. I had a friend who did drugs but he didn't kill anyone. That I know of.  Finaly they killed the idiot, but only after nearly everyone else was dead. Then that stupid woman the guy was marrying wanted him to kill his friend and the DOG! What kind of sick person would want to kill the dog? It never murdered anyone or slept with prostitutes or did drugs. The dog should have been the hero of the movie. I forget what happened to the dog, because I stopped watching the movie there and went to get a drink. Anyway, this movie is something that only a murdering, raping, dog-hating druggie would want to watch, over and over. I'd rait it zero stars but I cant.
 If the producers knew anything about Deaf Culure they would have picked an actual deaf actress to play the role. It is not only offensive but is not even remotely realistic in showing what deafness and deaf culture is like. It only shows a helpless deaf girl who magically hears after getting a cochlear implant. Come on. It takes 3 months to heal after the surgery and even get the thing turned on and then years of speech therapy etc for it to be successful, IF its even successful. The actor was cute, I'll give them that much but isn't it time to let the Deaf act for themselves.
 Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap. As in a Festival of Crap. As in craptacular. As in a movie that would make Plan Nine From Outer Space look like Fellini and Dunston Checks In look like Woody Allen's finest creations. I personally cannot imagine how anyone with the IQ of a rhesus monkey would give this movie two stars, let alone five. I'm guessing that the cast members desperately e-mailed their moms and begged them to write bogus reviews on Amazone. Either that or an army of zombie reviewers, the clones of Rex Reed, are out there on the loose, writing wildly enthusiastic reviews of anything that was shot even remotely in focus.  I mean, if someone ever told me they liked this movie, I would immediately begin looking for their lobotomy scars. Shall I number just a few of the reasons? 1) Miserable, whiny music throughout the entire abomination that makes the Free Credit Report Dot Com band sound like the freaking Beatles and Rolling Stones all rolled into one. 2) Terrible plot with too many twists and turns--and yet completely and utterly predictable at the same time. 3) Cardboard characters, with Cybil Shepard playing a crazed mother, probably channeling her on-screen rage by thinking of her agent and wondering how she was roped into this woofer. 4) Possibly the worst dialog I've ever heard in a movie. Honestly, I've seen third grade Christmas pageants with better lines.  My God. I cannot believe I watched this craptacular thing, and am seriously considering divorcing my wife for choosing this on Netflix, no matter how many times she apologizes to me. Mind you, I NEVER write movie reviews on Amazon, let alone dish the dirt on ones this bad. But I feel I have a duty to humanity and to you, my fellow movie enthusiast. Listen To Your Heart will be 100 minutes of your life that you'll never get back again, precious time that will be better spent watching another movie, helping the poor, mowing your grass, rearranging your sock drawer, or even downloading midget porn for your later satisfaction. Anything but this. You'll thank me. Trust me on this.
 The cliche's
 The synopsis for this film was so intriguing I had to rent it.  After watching it, I can't decide which was worse - the writing or the acting.  I'm going to have to go for the writing, since clever and creative writing very, often saves shoddy acting abilities.  Oh wait, there was also painful musical numbers.  Wow, this is a tough one.  I'll stick with the writing.  What could have been a very interesting premise, was shot down by glib, cliche, canned and mediocre dialogue.  It started out with a glimmer of hope and quickly sank in a pool of woes.  Think of it as a one hour and forty minute cross section of a really bad soap opera, then throw in some really bad music and singing and that about covers it.  Poor, yet heroic waiter with aspirations of being a song writer meets beautiful, rich deaf girl with a monster, control freak mother who doesn't want them to see each other.  Once that turmoil is resolved then one of the characters instantly comes down with a terminal illness with all the typical scenes that go along with that. No, I'm not kidding.  Best to say it's a mix of "Fame" within the setting of "The Days of Our Lives" and an ending laced with  "A Walk to Remember," without the eloquence, depth or talent of either.  If I could take back my rental fee I would.  AND they are trying to recommend the musical CD that goes along with this film!  That would also have to be a NO.  Next......
 I've lost all faith in reviews. I'm one of the most generous star-givers out there, and I could not find anything good about this movie. I chose it based on reviews, but I just can't believe that anyone, let alone a majority, could give this 5 stars.  Beware of this one unless you like sappy, poorly acted, unrealistic films, with really bad music.  I hung in there until the end waiting for it to get better, but it just kept nose-diving deeper and deeper.
 This review is only for the disc, not the movie.  I bought this DVD back in 2009 and left it sitting unopened on a shelf with my other DVDs. Last night I finally opened the package for the first time and tried to watch it and the disc wouldn't even play. Started stuttering in the opening scene and never got better. After 5 minutes of the movie stuttering and jumping around I finally turned it off. Very aggravating.  Thinking it might be the DVD player I got out my old DVD player that I'd recently replaced with a blu ray player and tried to play it on that one as well with the same result.  Bottom line, the disk is defective/poor quality. Seeing as I bought this 2 years ago I'm not very confident that Amazon would even consider replacing it so I'm just going to have to eat the loss.  Can't recommend this product at all. I'd give it zero stars if possible.
 Comedies don't normally age well because there are only so many times you can hear a joke without getting sick of it and so films of that ilk normally represent sort of a time capsule of what the key events and issues of the time were that concerned people and hence what was funny to them at that time.  For those of us that are not of that time dated jokes leave us asking "huh?".  Unfortunately, this film falls into that category and while there are a few scenes especially between Palin and Cleese that drew a smile from me in remembrance of the great Python days the rest of the film was desperately dated and had me looking at the clock wishing it would end.  1988 must also have been a very bad year for films as that would explain how Kline could win his Oscar.  Cleese is a funny actor but he is certainly not a scriptwriter.  From the opening credits that were in an off-putting deep blue to the horrible score and background music this film doesn't even begin well.  Highly overrated and a film that ages very, very poorly it isn't helped by this very poor dvd version with horrible mono sound quality and even worse picture quality that is full of white spots and other imperfections.  There are no special features to speak about like interviews or making-of documentaries as well.  It's actually embarassing that Cleese and Palin could actually put their names to this film given the vastly superior output that they were involved in from their Python days.  Avoid at all cost!
 I loved Kevin Kline in "Dave" and Jamie Lee Curtis in "Trading Places", so I sadly wasted my time and money on this vulgar and silly garbage.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!
 Its interesting how time takes its toll on art, music, movies and the truth. I was happy that Oliver Stone rushed this film into theaters in hopes that its extremely unfavorable painting of the current President would help John Kerry defeat him. Theater goers stayed away in droves....maybe due to the poor reviews maybe because they felt they were living it and too close (my reasoning)and others maybe pulled the plug on believing Oliver Stone could make anything relevant a decade before.  Now that we have plenty of accurate accounts of the events portrayed in this film its clear it was historically wrong (a book could be written on that alone) and on top of that poor film making. Oliver Stone's cement style heavy handed approach seems directed to either left wing haters or those in the audience with IQs in the double digits. This story should, and still could, be done in a way which is less black and white and much much more in the mid tones. Stone's portrayal of these individuals is extremely one dimensional and often comical! For a glimpse at how ridiculous this movie is just listen to the actress playing Condi Rice for five seconds and you can get an accurate gauge on the entire movie.  These are real life people and yet the screenplay and movie inject less into them than a good movie with imagined characters!  How can you take this movie maker seriously when he refuses to inject any humanity into anybody in the story he does not like?  Its almost impossible to make a movie of events while they are still unfolding...and Stone's joke of a film W. proves that. Stone is chasing relevance with his film making for some time  and continuing to fail....football, 911, George Bush,  and more recently Wall Street again.  If he has to keep making movies perhaps he should find another Tarantino (who scripted Natural Born Killers) and just direct a brilliant script by somebody who actually HAS a voice. His chasing trends instead of setting them ...has failed.  I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy train wrecks and car crashes...because that is what this is.  If you want to have fun at George W Bush's expense...then watch the hilarious Will Ferrell DVD <a href="http
 So easy for people to applaud a movie like this when you still have both of your legs, are NOT on almost 10 medications just for your head alone due to severe PTSD, nightmares and panic attacks... Oh, and you basically don't LIVE at the VA hospital and don't have the privilege to compare mental inpatient treatment programs across the globe about every other year. I am only 32 years old, for Christ's sake (which is actually OLD compared to most of the injured vets that have come home/coming home)! His place in history for me? A murderer of my comrades as well as The American version of a "dictator." ... And I may actually have to tell my grandchildren (if I live to have any) that this man was my "Commander-In-Chief."  Yes, I am extremely angry, and have every right to be. It will take me AGES to heal. Now choke on that. I guess ignorance really is bliss, heh.
 I'm not going to lie. I did not like this movie. I am one of the suckers that bought this movie. I should have rented it. The Conda-LEEza Rice impression would have been worth three bucks, but not $25.  I found it dull and didn't really discover anything new. The best recommendation I have for this movie is to go rent it if you really want to see it and then judge for yourself if you really want to buy it.  The characterizations are funny, but don't carry this boring story. Unless you love George W. Bush or been living under a rock the last eight years, why bother?
 This latest peice of Stone crypto-conservative misdirection all but overlooks the single major factor in all the decisions that affected the Bush family's lives
 This was a painful and skimmed-over review of the life of George W. Bush.  It's as if Oliver Stone had in mind to capture certain elements of Bush's "hidden agendas" while in office, and as the "brilliant film maker" he continues to feel that he is, tried to display those agendas through underlying themes within the movie.  Stone probably feels as many Americans do; that Bush is so self-absorbed and narcissistic that he often "misses the forest for the trees".  And, that Stone himself would be able to pass an articulate piece of film making by this president as a historic and valuable piece of art, while exposing the Bush agenda and wrongdoings. (Kind of like Frost did with Nixon, only this would be in movie form.)  I was in hopes that his film would rejuvenate my positive views of W.  I voted for him in 2000, but I was certain to not make that mistake again in 2004.  The W Administration was a joke and a blight on the history of America.  I felt that Stone may be able to pull off something less generic and create something more personal so that I may make some sense of this President's selfish, misguided and corrupt antics.  The truth is, this film encapsulated many of the real facts of W's life.  None of which really give him the foundation to make a credible and responsible presidential leader of our country.  W proves to be an uncaring, narcissistic, greedy man that cannot ever admit any wrongdoings.  He proves to be self-righteous, confused about his goals/direction, somewhat insecure, and growing up completely spoiled, as a child AND as a man.  His personal life is wrought with family dysfunction as he lives in his father's shadow.  Sadly, W appears he will accept any sympathy anyone offers him for this kind of family dysfunction. It's a disturbing film when you realize that W probably agreed to this work before its release and potentially feels that this film, in part, may put him in a better light. Or, worse yet, that this film may help distribute and absolve the blame and consequences of his faulty administration.  The undertones of priming Jeb for an upcoming presidential election are quite obvious.  And, I believe at some point during the making of this film, Stone sells out.  I believe that he comes to realize that there is no perfect way to exploit the truths that would expose the Bushes, so he goes with the simplest path; Those that are the generic and obvious truths that the Bush family would have to agree with. And sadly, that is precisely what you get.
 W. didn't tell us anything we didn't already know. Although George was almost charming in this movie, it didn't tell us anymore than we've already seen on CNN. Personally I was hoping to see a little about the year before 911 and maybe some Paul O'Neil.
 The movie was a clear attempt to make Bush look like a complete fool.  Did Stone really need to show him in the bathroom wiping????  Is Bush always eating?  When he eats is he always talking?  Is the Bush family really that dysfunctional and hateful to each other?  I know its just one mans "story" of another mans life, but it almost seemed like it could have been done by Michael Moore as it was so one sided.
 Oliver Stone has proven once and for all that his agenda has destroyed his artistic insight and objectivity. This movie is dreadful, it is as if Stone was picked on by some bully kid named W. in elementary school and has sworn revenge. He offers "insights' that he could not possibly know and plays the Bush family as a bunch of power mad zealots with George W. as a buffoon and George H.W. as a whiny weak man. Stone clearly has an agenda here, He shows Dick Cheney and Karl Rove as the puppetmasters controlling the BUsh administration and Condeleesa Rice as an Uncle Tom-ish character. This is a hatchet job if ever there was one. W. may not have been the most articulate of statesmen but he was never mean, this depiction is just plain mean spirited and unwarranted, and most importantly it isn't even good film making.
 this film is another example of oliver stone's distorted view of america and it's political leaders , and in this instance it is nothing more than his leftist imagination running out of control .  in this film he takes a number of actual events and then creates his own version of the conversations that might have occurred at that time while making it seem like they actually happened .  in each instance he goes to great lengths to make the president seem like an arrogant and uninformed gunslinger .  there is no reason to believe any of the purported dialogue actually happened , and if you are looking for a historical film based on reality , this is not it .  stay tuned for stone's upcoming films on che guervara , mao tse tung , pol pot , and other stone heroes for i am sure that they will be full of praise for them , and will gloss over their record of butchery .
 I purchased the movie with some scepticism. As I have always believed, "Consider the Source".  The scepticism payed off.  Oliver Stone has always been known as a liberal thinking leftist.  How do we think he will show George W. Bush to be other than an alcoholic, lazy fool.  We should try to remember that Bush was elected by the american people for two consecutive terms of office.  He must have done something right.  Stone did his best to show George W. to be a complete idiot using lies to confuse the viewers of the film and mixing lies with the truth to attack the former president.  The film was very difficult to fallow due to the broken lapses of time, back and forth and so on.  I was not only very dissapointed with Stone's film making, but was apalled by the total lack of honesty in giving a true story of George W. Bush's life and administration.  In the past I have always enjoied Oliver Stone's films such as Wall Street, Platoon, Talk Radio and JFK.  He did well with these films.  But I find "W." to be a complete failure.  Better luck in the future, Oliver!
 This movie will not tell you anything more about the Bush presidency than you don't know already.  It glazes over Bush's life, and presidency, and most of it is probably NOT factual.  It will not help you understand why decisions were made.  Oliver Stone does not uncover any "plots".  It is simply a silly movie that basically tests the actors to see who can do the best impersonations of the real-life characters they are imitating (The award goes to Richard Dreyfuss as Cheney).  Do not buy this movie.  It is the worst waste of money.  I was sorry I spent money to see it in the theater.  1 Star is an OVER-rating.
 one thing certain, Oliver Stone doesn't like GW Bush.  i didn't vote for him the first time and i was somewhat dismayed when he took office, but this film is a hatchet job.  i recall seeing something called Red, White and Maddox, a parody of Lester Maddox, the erstwhile leader of Georgia.  this film is in the same vein.  if you wish to make a parody, then call it that.  how many people, after viewing  W.  will actually think that Stone's portrait of W was something true to life, that he actually engaged  in fistacuffs with his father, over every issue.  if Oliver Stone wishes to make funny  political satire, i suggest he view THE SENATOR WAS INDISCREET with William Powell.  that film was a sidesplitting take of the goings on in Washington DC circa the late 1940's.  it tells the story of a bumbling senator's campaign for the presential nomination, where he comes out foursquare against assasination, and utilizes the diary he's kept  for years which details the foilbles of everyone in politics  as a wedge to keep his political life in high gear.
 This is a mixture of some truth mixed with a liberal viewpoint.  Oliver Stone made a statement to the movie world thru his own beliefs as usual.  I found it cruel and unfair to our former president. The only good thing was I think the actors did a good job with accents.  I bought this to give to my Dad (who is a Democrat) thinking he would like it, but I am too embarrased to give it to him now.  People deserve their dignity, and I don't think it was given in this movie.
 I get it when I watch a movie by Oliver Stone that he's gonna bring his own personal agenda into it.  However, I'd been pleasantly surprised by his filmmaking before like 9/11 where he remained solemn and pretty much politically neutral. But he threw all of that out the window in making W.  I voted for George W. Bush twice and appreciated his strong leadership through some very difficult moments in our nation's history guided by his faith in God who sustained him through it all.  Stone chose to mock Bush's faith and attempt to paint him as a hypocrite and a blundering idiot.  He is neither.  President Bush did more good for this country than people give him credit for which has become all the more apparent with the buffoon who's running the White House these days.  At every opportunity in W, we see Bush made to look like a little kid who needs to be reprimanded and George W. Bush deserves better than this.  I'll give Josh Brolin credit, he got the role down perfect--although I'm sure Oliver Stone coached him to play up the idiocy more than what the real President Bush exhibited.  I suffered my way through the entire flick and left wondering what the point of this film was beyond bashing what history will show as one of the most monumental presidencies in our nation's history.  GOD BLESS YOU PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH!
 I personally thought that Stone really dropped the ball on this film. "JFK" is one of the best political films ever, and "W" is more like a extra long version of a SNL skit. The portrayals of W's staff were more parodies than portrayals. Thandie Newton is a great actress ( NOT TO MENTION FINE), but her performance as Rice was pathetic. What was even worse than that one was the one of Powell, Keanu Reeves could have made a better Colin Powell. The rest were almost as bad. All Stone accomplished was taking good actors and making them play bad parts to try and destroy the image of a sitting President. That is obvious to even the most casual observer.
 As usual, we have a producer/director that thinks he knows what's going on in the world; when, in my opinion, it's all in his own mind.  The movie, in my opinion, is totally slanted.  Portraying W as weak and readily lead to decisions by any one.  Tell me, those of you that think that you are so intelligent, what would you have done if you were president when the tragedy of 9/11 happened?  How about having the worst hurricane season right after?  No, the problems in New Orleans weren't W's fault after Katrina.  Look to the governer and mayor (who was elected again although he let New Orleans go to hell during Katrina).  At some point the people in the US have to start taking responsibility for themselves.  Do I recommend the movie W?  Only if you want to push your problems off on the government.  Then again, if you want to do that, you have to go back many years.
 I've been renting and watching movies which feature scenes inside the White House, to see how the inner circle works. "13 Days" is by far the best I've seen.  I've read the memoirs of many of the central players in Stone's cast, CIA Director Geo. Tenet, Colin Powell, Undersecretary of Defense Feith, former CINCs. While I disagree with them on various points, none of them seem to differ on Bush's persona.  He was not retarded, as Stone portrays him.  They all say he was business, very presidential.  Watching this utter craphole of a movie, I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch, something Lorne Greene would give us.  Yes, it was that silly.  I was embarrassed for Oliver Stone, embarrassed for everyone in it.  When the actors in it went to the premier and saw the edited version for the first time, they surely must have walked out with jackets covering their heads, it was that bad.  Thinking there might be something worthwhile in the commentary, I watched it again with Stone's comments running... and he pretty much spells out his entire liberal philosophy on life.  Contrary to what reviewer "Jon" would hv you believe, Stone doesn't put a conservative spin on anything, far from it.  Stone launches into liberal diatribes while at the same time admitting he doesn't really know the man, says he and his writer, Stanley Weiser, are just guessing what he's like, making scenes up, taking dramatic license, fabricating dialogue from thin air.. saying stuff like, "I thought doing the two scenes on the toilet shows us the real George Bush, a man who has no home."  That's not a dignified or respected director's work, that's a sophomoric high school student trying to be funny in a class project short.  And that's the way the whole film comes across, sophomoric and high school, only with a larger budget.  At the end, Stone says the Administration was a failure not only to liberals like himself but also to conservatives, with the budget deficits and destroying of the Constitution..  Wonder what Stone thinks about the Obama Administration which really is destroying the Constitution and is running a larger deficit in 1 year than Bush's 8 years.  What will Stone's take on the Obama White House look like?  Probably a cartoon entitled B. HUSSEIN O. with three scenes of Pres. BO on the toilet.  Save 2 hrs of your life, there was nothing redeeming about this movie. The acting was particularly strained, cardboard, and awful by all, EXCEPT for Keach who masterfully plays the preacher with the hairlip, and the guy who resigns at the Pecan Pie meeting - who was hired for that one scene and was the only believable actor in it.  I don't know how "Jon" got his review so wrong, he obviously didn't watch the movie or listen to Stone's commentary track.  Can't wait for B.O. to come out before the 2012 election.
 I was quite disappointed in Oliver Stone's "W."  He does a terrific job of portraying George W. Bush as a psychological basket-case.  And this is fine.  W. was and is a personality of feeble intellect and stunted, 7-year-old emotions.  But that's all Stone does.  He leaves it at that.  Imagine if a movie were made about Hitler or Stalin and only covered their psychological problems.  No doubt they had them.  But the only reason people would care is the enormity of their crimes.  Same here.  SOME time should have been devoted to W's idiotic, murderous, neglectful, help-the-rich and kick-the-poor policies.  On the other hand, Thandie Newton is terrific as Condoleeza Rice; and Richard Dreyfus is superb as Cheney.
 WARNING!!! THIS title does NOT work on AUSTRALIAN PLAYERS. Contrary to what this web site says, IT IS REGION ONE!!!
 I realize I am a latecomer in the reviews for this film, and Obama is succeeding in his competition for the title of our worst president (isn't it convenient that as of yesterday, he is able to take credit for killing Bin Laden...just in time for his re-election campaign?). However, I expected much more from the director of JFK (which still doesn't do justice to the conspiracy, but at least debunks the Warren Commission).  I'm only about 1/2 an hour into this film, and I have already spotted some glaring errors. There's Phi Delta Kappa, the fake fraternity that W is shown being initiated into (apparently Stone has been intimidated into keeping silent that W is a Bonesman), and W claiming to be a Texan (he was born in Maine) and an Episcopalian (he's a Catholic), and there's still another 90 minutes to go!  The best film out there if you want the truth about both W and 911 is Alex Jones 911-The Road to Tyranny.
 As someone said in an earlier review, "If you hate Bush, you'll probably like this..."  Well, I hate Bush and I hated the movie!  Unlike with Nixon, Stone was too easy on him.  I suspect, however, that the film reflects most of the truth.  As much as I diagree with all that Bush was about, I think that he was genuine in his love for this Country and meant the best for it.  I was just a bit shocked that Stone let him off the hook so easily.
 After I downloaded the movie W. , the movie stops playing at 1 hour 42 min. I have deleted the file and the Unbox player and reinstalled and downloaded the movie and THE EXACT THINGS HAPPENS AGAIN AT THE SAME TIME AS BEFORE !! Amazon has really disappointed me this time because the purchase is useless to me. Even the troubleshooter within Unbox cannot fix this AND AMAZON STILL HAS MY MONEY FOR ONLY 3/4th of a movie that I paid for. I am thinking that I will go back to BlockBuster movie downloads in the future since I have no problems with digital downloads with that company. As of this date, 3-8-09 NOBODY FROM AMAZON has contacted me for a resolve to this issue. How 'bout that customer service ?
 Stone, ever the friend of Hugo Chavez, manages to make a boring movie about the first American President who virtually by his will alone manages to free millions of Iraqi's from a tyrant and his homocidal sons.  Providing a chance for rule by the people (not okay with Stone or Chavez - unless the "people" are really socialist rulers) may be the most pernicious assault on the oppressive regimes of the arabic world.  If freedom takes root, "W" may yet be born out by history.  Meanwhile Oliver's boring little movie, which I struggled to get through, will go down as one of his least history rewriting films.  Even Brolin's acting is weak.  But no matter -- we await with breathless anticipation Stone's coming and glowing movies on "Chavez!" and "Che!" and "Ahmindinajad!" Count on them to get great reviews from the N.Y. Slimes -- errr N.Y. Times.
 I think the movie, "W" was well-done, although it's not my favorite.  That's probably because it's about politics, one of my least favorite subjects.  Richard Dreyfuss and Josh Brolin were the only actors I knew by name, but the movie still held my attention with all the punches 'George W. Bush' gave; that was what made the movie interesting.
 Needless to say, movie stinks, especially for a sitting president at the time of it's release. I think Stone should now make the movie "0" and show how Obama is paying off all his buddies, or make fun of how much of an idiot he looks like everytime he opens his mouth, or how inept he is at the job he worked so hard to win, that will never happen. You can go ahead an trust all the wonderful reviews of the drones on here that all seem to have some sort of unified thought pumped into their minds kinda like the borg in startrek, oh wait they do, it's called the news and hollywood, never mind.
 This film is an awful insult to a GREAT president, I am unfathomably appalled by how the average American feels towards Bush. He was a vital asset to this country in very trying times, he had to make some extremely difficult decisions during his time in office and I think that he made nearly every single one of them correctly. This movie is merely a statement of the ignorance of the American public, primarily those in Hollywood. Do not support this propaganda!
 I don't like Oliver Stone and his movies (except World Trade Center) and I think he's a stupid film maker. This movie is another failure like Alexandre and JFK..... I think one star is even too much for it. ((BDS stands for Bush Derangement Syndrome - I believe Oliver Stone suffers from BDS too))
 I have an abiding interest in American politics, and by extension the personalities and philosophies of our presidents. That made the PBS American Experience series on the presidents a natural choice. I thought I should give this dramatized depiction a try, especially considering how well the former president seems to lend himself to parody.  This film, though, isn't aimed at parody. It's certainly silly, and perhaps intended for the shortest-attention, lowest-common-denominator audience. It's certainly not serious from a documentary or biographical perspective. Most of the content seems embellished. The only framing is a handful of major events of which most Americans are already aware.  The actors are clearly intended to represent actual politicians, but their looks / voices / mannerisms are far from convincing. The result is a sort of uncanny valley, where you expect these actors to represent reality but they have flaws that are hard to pinpoint exactly. It's not even a psychoanalysis, because any introspection is superficial and stereotypical. On that note, the constant riffs on Bush's Texas heritage and accent wear out quickly.  In terms of other story elements
 This is one of the worst made movies I have ever seen. It is a mess, tells the most confused view of Bush I have ever seen, suggests there was a little good a little bad in the man, nothing new and no insights either good or bad. What a waste of time (for reference Fahrenheit 911 I thought was brilliantly made - one either hated it or loved it, but it was well made and sure got its point across.) W gets nothing across other than the director had not a clue about what he was doing or even trying to do.
 This film is just a political cartoon showing a caricature of George Bush.  I've seen George Bush interviews on TV many many times.  I've read books about Bush from several different authors.  (I read a lot of books about historical figures.)  My Dad has interacted with George W Bush.  The film fails to show the friendly compassionate Bush that so many talk about.  I'm no fan of George W Bush's politics, but this film is a flat one sided approach to a person who has a friendly compassionate side that doesn't show up in the film.
 How utterly disgusting - I thought colorization as a practice had long sense been abandoned because of the overwhelmingly negative public reaction to it in the 1980s. And now it rears its ugly head again at the expense of one of the great swashbuckling classics. With hundreds of unreleased treasures in their vault, Fox has the audacity to do this. I, for one, am boycotting everything Fox until they come to their senses. If they want to release classic films in color, how about "The Gang's All Here", or "Weekend in Havana", or any of the dozen or so other classic technicolor Fox musicals?
 ...by not buying Fox's idiotic attempt to colorize one of the great screen classics. Yikes, will they NEVER learn?!?!?
 This is the worst transfer to dvd that I've ever seen.  My vhs copy from TCM is much better!  I love the film, but was bitterly disappointed at the shoddy treatment.  Shame!!!
 Almost two decades after Ted Turner put away his crayons and stopped "colorizing" the MGM and Warner Brothers classics ... and Now, when most of the industry is focused on restoring films to their original brilliance and releasing them on DVD in pristine condition ... Fox Home Video is choosing to shoot themselves and their customers in the foot by re-releasing their highly vaunted "Studio Classics" in ghastly computer-colored versions that feature washed-out transfers and pale, unappealing tints.  Oh!  And in the case of "The Mark of Zorro", they're charging a little bit more than they did for the black-and-white version ... a higher price for a lot less quality.  What are these people thinking?!  Do yourself - and the world - a favor by not encouraging Fox to continue this travesty.  Colorization mercifully died a long time ago, and deserves to remain dead.  (If you want more professional looking color, just watch the black and white version with a layer of multi-colored Jello smeared on your TV screen.)  Shame on you, Fox!  You've got hundreds of films in your vaults that the public is eagerly waiting for.  Better to preserve and release them before they crumble to dust than to try and grab a few extra dollars by hideously tampering with titles you've already released.
 This is a terrible movie version of a pretty exciting book. Frank Sinatra was and never could be Joseph Ryan. He was totally miscast in this role. I have a feeling he was a producer who acquired the rights for himself thinking that he could play the part. So wherever you are, Frankie, it didn't work!
 Roger Ebert gave this film 1/2 a star...he was too kind. First off I want to apologize, I really do. I'm sorry for breaking my new years resolution so soon.  I resolved that I would never again write a negative review on amazon, that I was always trashing everything and I was making people angry and that if I didn't like something I should shut up about it.  Then I saw Josie and the Pussycats.  I have never been more embarrassed for a bunch of actors.  I loved Charlie's Angles and thought this would be like that only with guitars, I was primed for some cool 70's retro music and some silly fun.  This movie was painful.  I have never seen worse acting, never.  If you watch you can see Parker Posie looking around as if she is waiting for the director to yell cut.  Someone should have.  The same tired old joke is rehashed countles times, that product placement is everywhere, Target logos inside the plane etc..  This was mildly funny once.  Once.  Rachel Leigh Cook is unsinkable.  She is so beautiful that she can make a film better simply by standing there, she is incapable of delivering a bad line no matter how poorly it is written, bravo Rachel, you poor brave girl.  To screw up a film like this takes hideous directing, editing and writing.  The jokes are old, the story is lame and the acting must be seen to be believed.  I was ashamed leaving the theater that someone would have seen me there, I need not have worried there were, perhaps 3 people in the whole multiplex...three too many.
 If this is what one calls "American Youth Culture", then let me say, for crying out loud..."Give Us All A Break"! The movie is nothing but an egotistical trip of a ...girlie rock band, trying to find its way in the typical corporate mainstream. I have to be honest, Hollywood media is so much based today on mainstream ..., that they tend to ignore the actual "American Youth Culture", that today is in fact leading towards the underground "DANCE SCENE". I really had admired movies like "Groove" and "Trainspotting" which truly reflected that particular club culture...which I guess will take years to finally hit the Hollywoood mainstream, which is so much obsessed with reflecting of what's "In" in terms of MTV, and the top 40's....
 My daughter has an old cartoon "Josie and the Pussycats" video from years ago which she likes to watch.  So when she wanted to buy this DVD with her Amazon credit, I said "sure."  I am sorry I did.  The characters are evil and nasty.  One character in particular uses an excessive amount of bad language to get her point across.  The story line is completely vapid.  This was a waste of money and I've hidden it so my daughter can't watch it again.
 This is not the nimble, intellectual satire that the movie makers, and reviewers on Amazon, would like you to think it is.  Beyond that, it is insulting, and may actually be a vehicle for the very product placement/power-of-suggestion marketing technique it claims to be skewering.  The movie doesn't really know what it wants to be, and it manages to NOT be any of the movies it's trying to be
 You don't get much dumber than this movie.. seriously it was horrible.  The only reason that I watched this was because it had a pretty good review on this website, where I get most of my reviews but I guess that reviews don't tell you everything.  Seriously, if you decide to watch this movie.. god help you, it is so bad and should never have been made.  Please, for the sake of your mental health, NEVER. EVER. EVER. watch this movie.
 I think in the years to come, when people are studying film, this movie, though a flop, will be discussed as an example of the large problem that product placement or "brand integration has become in Hollywood. Josie and the Pussycats is bad enough to begin with (despite having the characters and general idea from the comic and early 70s TV cartoon, the movie really didn't succeed in transferring the feel of the comic to the screen -- Alexander and Alexandra are wasted); but when the viewer is assaulted by product placement throughout it just becomes too much. I have never felt so insulted by a movie.  This isn't a story, it's an hour and a half advertisement. Products and logos are so awkwardly inserted into every frame that I was overwhelmed. The filmmakers claim it's a subversive in-joke
 The only reason to watch this movie is that there are cute girls in it.  If you like it for any reason other than that, you are stupid.
 First off. This comes as a DVD-R not a pressed DVD, so incompatibility might occur on some DVD Players. That being said, this is DVD rip of a VHS master. It's ok, it's basically the fundamental of Wing Chun. Not very good in the details. No chapter stops. I believe it's only 30 minutes long. I would say that the cost and quality exceeds the value of this DVD.
 The DVD cover looked good online but it is nothing more than a inkjet printed cover.  Poor audio.  No structure on topics covered.  Nothing more than a home video with the Master and his students demonstrating some aspects of wing chun. Could be better but for now really poor show.  For the price I paid for it, simply not worth the money.
 This attempt at a teenage 'When Harry Meet Sally' is perhaps the most unsettling films I have seen in quite some. How could any highly - paid studio executive OK this - the cast and script rank among the worst I have every seen. Prinze was wrong for the lead (Rushmore lead would have done much better), while Biggs was sleepwalking through the picture. This could have been a very good teen pic - but the script needed work. The end result is a painful waste of our time and money - and the studios money. Avoid - at all cost. Instead(same genre)
 This movie was terrible.  Basically Freddie Prince and Claire Forlani have a habit of running into each other before they eventually become friends and then, of coarse, more than friends.  Nothing in this film was original.  Prince and Forlani don't like each other at first, they have strange best friends, and a final sequence in the airport where one of them is leaving. The only redeaming parts of this film are Forlani's beauty and some decent comic relief provided by Jason Biggs, who plays Prince's roommate and only friend.  In fact the funniest part of this movie happens during the final credit sequence in which Biggs has a dream with Victoria Secret models that want him to fart.  Other than that this movie was just a waste.
 The quality of this DVD is appalling, and virtually unwatchable. Althought I understand that the footage is old, I had no idea that it would be so bad that it makes most amateur videos look like award-winning examples of cinematography! It is difficult to see the kata being performed clearly, and due to the absence of audio in the clips (the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end), the breathing cannot be heard. The video is blurry, dark and visually  ;noisy ;.  The funeral scene at the end is so dark, it is difficult to see anything at all. Don't waste your money
 I just received my 10th season and all 4 discs were all badly scratched.  CBS/Paramount's quality of their DVDs is the worse of all studios.  I think because they have so many rights to TV shows and are putting them out at a fast pace, regardless of the quality of the DVDs.  CBS/Paramount needs to get their act together and start putting out quality unscratched DVDs.
 I wish I could rate this two ways. I believe it should get 5+ stars for it's illumination of one modern Catholic's mindset, but must give it 1 star for how wrongheaded the enterprise was written and directed. The director, Kevin Smith, has called this film  ;...my love-letter to God and to faith - which is about the only thing we really truly have in life. ; This should surprise a great number of the critics of this film who wrongly believe Smith is slamming the Church. He further states,  ;Faith is the glue that holds us together and binds us (kind of like the Force). It's something we all have in common - even if you're not a religious person. ; Clearly this shows he is NOT the faithless iconoclast as portrayed by the good-hearted but misguided efforts of the Catholic League, but rather this is a man whose movie is a statement of his faith as he understands it. And while it is intentionally satirical of many things, if viewed not as a slam but as a love-letter, a well catechized Catholic can gain some pretty incredible insights from it. I'm not promoting this movie in regards to how well it expresses the Catholic Faith - far from it. It is wildly inaccurate and largely ignorant of history or of the arguments that underlie fundamental beliefs of (most) Catholics. But there is a payoff. Watch this movie and realize something
 Dogma is probably one of if not Kev's worst films. How a Catholic can Make this movie is beyond me. As a Catholic myself I wouldn't cross the line for the sake of "Art" if that's what people think art is that's their problem. Kevin is a very talented Guy as are the cast it's sad.
 I think what bothered me most about this movie was that it thought it had something intelligent to say. Unfortunately a more cogent argument against religious dogma could be formulated by a 4 year old. And then there's the script. Was this a first draft? The acting was also horrendous, with incredibly annoying performances by Rock, Damon, and Affleck, but with a script like this that was inevitable. In short, do not pay money to see this garbage! Kevin Smith is a one trick pony and needs to stick to stories involving New Jersey and convenience stores.
 While Kevin Smith does an adequite job in steeping the movie with religious dogma (and for the most part keeping it legitimate) he loses himself somewhere along the plot line and turns what would be a thought  provoking look at church doctrine and turns the movie into something  reminiscent of a Zucker brothers movie (complete with uninspired fart  jokes.) Keep it mindless or keep it serious but the schitzophrenic nature  of this film does not do justice to the brilliant ideas Smith introduces to  us in the beginning of the film.  I give this film one star because as a  huge fan of Kevin Smith, I really hoped he could have done better.
  ;Dogma ; is about a total moron who spouts off, and everyone else shaking their head at him in a benign way. I'm not making that up. Also, if you're doing a satire, never have a cutesy apology appear before the movie starts. Jonathan Swift or Terry Southern never did that. You either believe in your vision, or you don't. Smith's problem is he wants to have things both ways. He's supposedly educating us on religion, and making us laugh with bathroom humor. Except he ends up doing neither. The religous stuff is just preaching to the converted, there's nothing insightful about what he's saying. And the humor is painfully forced, unfunny, and over the top vulgar. Don't get me wrong, I love lowbrow humor as much as anyone. But this movie is basically for anyone who still gets a kick out of hearing themselves or other people curse. It reminded me of a  ;Scooby Doo ; episode written by a pretentious hack philosophy student. Damon and Affleck's lame performances exemplify the movie's smug, pleased with it itself tone. They seem more interested in entertaining themselves than the audience. And you have to be really untalented to make George Carlin and Chris Rock not funny.
 this movie is boring, boring, boring. smith's flat satire lacks subtlety and grace and is redeemed (relatively speaking) only by its moments of ridiculous humor - a feces demon, horny jay, screeching chris rock et al.  the damn thing isn't even offensive, except in the sense i paid for the  rental.  cheap shot? worthy target.
 After Watching this film i feel Kevin Smith Should Seek a Real Job.this Film was Horrible.part Bill&amp;Ted's Excellent Adventure part History of the World part 1&amp;the Rest all junk.Chris Rock is Flat in this Film.same  goes for Linda Fiorentino.Matt Damon&amp;Ben Affleck add nothing to this  Poor Excuse of Film-Making.i see nothing funny in this Mockery of  Catholicism.it's a Travety that this Film was even ever made.
 I am not a Catholic, or member of any other organized religion for that matter, so I was eagerly expecting irreverent, intelligent, and witty theo-illogical comedy from Dogma.  What I experienced was more like a bad  acid trip commandeered by graduate-school PC theological tedium mixed with  prepubescent sex and scat jokes.  This movie has no reason to exist beyond  the smattering of one-liners and a certain stoner hipness, but even these  are cliched or pretentious beyond tolerability.  Even the considerable  talents of its ensemble cast can't save this drivel from the postmodern  trash heap. If this is what ex-Catholics are struggling with, god help  them! This film is an insult to anyone with an ounce of spirituality left  in them.  It knows not from whence it came nor what it wants to say.  Honestly the worst film I've seen in years.
 What a worthless, childish and pretentious movie. It`s supposed to be a satire on catholicism, but is such an inane film that I almost felt pity for it. So this is what a hip, clever, witty movie should be nowadays, eh? Well, in fact it`s just a lame mess. The beginning isn`t bad, Damon and Affleck have a couple of entertaining scenes with some black humour, but it doesn`t last for too long and soon falls into mediocrity. The film seems endless and gets worse from scene to scene. In the end,  ;Dogma ; is a failed parody with a few decent moments and a lot of crap. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the acting bland and the direction shows little creativity. While it's strange, different and offbeat, it doesn`t qualify as being actually something worthwhile and poignant. A letdown.
  ;Ambitious ;?  ;Funny ;?  ;Aggressively Intelligent ;?  Unlike those enlightened souls who found this a five-star hit, I guess I just didn't  ;get it. ;  I saw this film in a theater and it has to be among the worse movies I've *ever* seen! If the DVD version can redeem it as worthy of time and expense, it's just another huge plus for the technology.  Maybe you have to be a Catholic or at least a Kevin Smith fan, but my advice would be
 I was very excited to see this movie.  I liked Clerks and Chasing Amy a lot.  I think people just like this movie because it is from this hip new director but if you took Kevin Smith's name off of the box I don't think this movie would have very many fans.  This movie didn't strike me as controversial or thought provoking.  It also wasn't funny or entertaining.  I was bored.  Kevin Smith's characters are constantly explaining the plot to you through the whole movie.  My english teacher always told me to show, not tell.  Apparantly Kevin Smith never learned this rule.  And on a side note, I know Chris Rock seems like a really funny guy, but is he ever funny in anything?
 Just the sexy, heavenly muse played by Salma Hayek wouldnormally be enough for me to scream out loud and give this movie aclean 5 on the scoreboard, but I don't. This film did nothing for me. I think I laughed twice during the whole film and that's not enough. Chris Rock does his best to make us laugh at the bad jokes this great comedian is stuck with and Salma Hayek tries to look as sexy as humanly possibly, but it's not enough.  Linda Fiorentino delivers well below average acting as she stumbles through the story as Bethany (be sure to be out for more popcorn when she tries to play drunk). And please, let's not even mention Smith Mewes and his pathetic character, Jay. One of the reasons I didn't like this movie a bit, might be because of a certain individual sitting three chairs to my right at the cinema. I have never, ever in my whole life heard anyone (or anything for that matter) with such a terrible laughter and I hope I will never hear him ever again. He laughed with his whole body and soul and it sounded like an old steam engine and a jumbo jet colliding in mid air then falling 10.000 feet to crash land in an amusement park. And the more he laughed, the more I wanted to walk over to him and kick him real hard.  That said, if Dogma had been a real good movie, I had never noticed  ;Laughterman ;. Dogma was not a real good movie. Stay clear of this one. There are brick walls more amusing than this film. And Alanis Morissette as God? Gimme a break...
 I'm not Catholic and perhaps I didn't "get it"; I wasn't offended by the excrement, etc. but the continuing sophmoric plot apparently intended to offend wore me down.  What a waste of talent (except, well, Affleck, stick to WRITING; you are SO wooden in your acting).  I hope all of those who were raised Catholic that were in the audience or in the movie FEEL better and their church-induced inhibitions have been wiped away after seeing or being in this flick.  The review of Shashank Tripathi (an Irish contemporary of mine) says it all well too.  It's only the second movie I ever walked out of (Drew Barrymore couldn't carry "Home Fries" all by herself; more wooden acting, not immature plotting, in that case).  They're lucky I didn't firebomb the theater on this one.  It was like the Worst of Saturday Night Live.  Grow up, Kevin.  You pseudo-intellectuals  givng this dreck 4 and 5 stars too.
 DOGMA has scores of "comedic moments pumped into it.  The problem is, none of them are the least bit funny.   Example
 Why does this movie suck this bad!this movie is dull and has no storyline.FACE THE FACTS.
 This movie goes so badly as movies can go... The duo of Damon and Affleck think they made a master-piece of controversy, but that's not case
 I hardly ever write reviews here, but when this awful movie appeared like a lurking demon to the left of my monitor I knew something had to be done. This movie was so bad that I walked out about 5 minutes before it ended at the theater. The only advantage to it on DVD is that it can be destroyed. If you like movies with terrible scripts, not-funny toilet humor, bad acting, poor direction, etc, then you MIGHT find this tolerable. How anybody could like this travesty is beyond me.
 What is there to say about this movie? The only good actors in it are Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, and George Carlin. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon couldn't act their way out of a paper bag if they had to. They're both the same in every single movie they're in, and they're both extremely annoying. I've always liked Kevin Smith's work, but this movie was simply appaling. That thing at the end with Alanis Morrisette as God.. BAD call Kevin, what the Hell was he thinking? Putting a racist person like Chris Rock in any movie as a character even remotely  ;righteous ; or  ;holy ; is an insult to anyone with a frontal lobe. And all this garbage with Jay... I nearly prayed to the porcelain idol after seeing him again. He's a bad, BAD actor; he's just not funny or creative at all. He makes me look hysterical. Somebody with a comedic side so devoid of talent shouldn't even be cast in a comedy. On a scale of 1-10 I'd give this movie a 3 or so, cause it does have some funny parts in it (not very many, but they're in there).
 Sorry. I'm just a stupid person, and unfortunately I coudl not see the so-called  ;greatness ; of this  ;Movie ;. It doesn't offends Catolhics at all, it doens't offend Protestants at all... It only  offends the intelligence of the public, forced to watch the horrible duo of  Affleck and Damon performing the worst characters of their movie carrer,  and forced to watch a ridiculous blonde guy using bad language all movie  long, and forced to watch the unshameful commercial appearance by Alanis  Morrissete, as a totally unconvincing God. For a person to think this  garbage is  ;polemic ;, he really must have his head closed to  daily life...
 Looks like someone's let their ambiton get the best of him.  This film is so F-ing boring and so F-ing unintersting that it just makes me wanna F-ing puke.  Usually I like witty comentary on biblical subjects but for the love of god, I like HUMOROUS witty comentary, not comentary so long a drawn out that you forget what the hell they were talking about in the first place.   Let's get one thing straight, movies are a forum for communicating ideas.  Not giving an actor/actress three pages of dialog and saying  ;read this to the camera, cause this is what I think ;.  That's what writers are for.  I don't go to a movie to be told flat out what some jackass thinks about christianity.  I go to be pursuaded and think,  ;oh, maybe he's got a point there. ; Kevin Smith is a direct product of the Hollywood mindframe.  Apparently he believes that making previous movies of moderate  fame gives him the right to make an opus of unintelligent hawgwash.  Man, the ego on this guy.   Kevin, if you're listening, go back to the low brow comedy of the past, and leave thought producing movies to real directors such as PT Anderson, or Joel/Ethan Coen.  Definantly the worst thing to come out of 1999.  Ciao Dave P.S.  All those people that found this movie  ;entertaining ;, and  ;utterly delightfull ; need to cut the BS, don't pretend like you get it just so you look somewhat witty and intelligent. I'm on to you.
 i saw this movie i should have brought with me my pillow and my blanket the movie was so bad i walked out of the movie holding my nose i should stayed at home and bored my self to sleep my friend thought that this  was a poor excause for a movie he said that it stunk even when we walked out we said why did we spend the money for this i should have saved my money  and bought baseball cards and i dont buy baseball cards
 I really did have high hopes going into the viewing of this movies.  Were those hopes met?  NO WAY.  I really can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie.  It's a  ;dark comedy ; as the two creators would like to think.  But Dark Comedies usually are intelligent and thought provoking, if not always entertaining.  This movie is simplistic and wraught with poor performances.  From the creators of the MALLRATS and CLERKS, I expected better.  All they could get out of great talents such as Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, and to a lesser degree Ben Affleck and Matt Damon is a monotonal emotionless walk-through of the script. This movie is the BOMB...er I mean A BOMB.
 I think Jonathan Rosenbaum, film critic for the Chicago Reader, said it the best.  This is a film about spirituality aimed at 11 year olds.  I found the film extraordinarily simplistic, boring, and obnoxious.  The charcters are really annoying, and the performances are quite bad (with Jason Lee coming across the worst as a devil like dude).  Affleck and Damon's characters end up being another variation on the know it all, smug, Gen X type who thinks he has all the answers, and enjoys pointing out everyone else's faults.  This was supposed to be Smith's "profound" film, but he's way out of his depth here.  Gen X filmmakers like Smith are not known for tackling big subjects, and when Kevin tries to tackle the heavy questions of existence here, he fails miserably.  Even though the film is a comedy, it still fails to really get into anything worthwhile.  It comes across as "existence for dummies".  Smith's previous film, Chasing Amy (his best in my opinion), is actually more profound than this film is.  It's an overly silly movie about religion.  I was just offended by the bad acting and filmmaking, not by the so-called "blasphemy" of the film.  The Catholic Church who protested this film were fools for doing so.  There's nothing worth bothering about here.
 This is without any doubt, the worst film I ever had the misfortune to see. Truly, impressively, stunningly awful, pretentious, stupid... just bad.
 I found DOGMA to be such a monumental waste of time that it set a real precedent in my life for a wasted evening.  As someone who can enjoy almost any well-intentioned movie this film was a total waste of time, energy and resources.  Since I am a lifelong confirmed horror and sci-fi fan I am not the least "high brow", nor do I hold any strong opinions regarding organized religion. I also would not consider myself to be prudish in any way and irreverence towards organized religion has never bothered me enough to spoil a good film.  When I went to the theater to see DOGMA I was on vacation in Newport Road Island with my wife when a trusted friend recommended that we see this film. The party in question shall remain nameless, but after seeing this movie I questioned his sincerity and certainly his advice from that day on. We also were not able to see the very excellent GREEN MILE which was also playing, and I suppose I regret missing that film as much as catching this one.  I am also dismayed at the number of multi-star votes this film received on Amazon. It would appear that the producer, director or some vast left wing conspiracy must be members of a large "family" (or some other organization) who have a vested interest in this film.  I simply can't believe the outcome of the Amazon statistics. Someone has been stuffing the ballot box!
 "Dogma," a film by Kevin Smith, is, in my opinion, a trite and confused bit of religious non-sense.  In one scene the characters appear to throw religion out the window in the interest of good-natured, irreverant fun, until all of it comes to a screeching halt, and the viewers find themselves suffering through sudden moments of sobriety in which either Matt Damon or his bland side-kick, Ben deliver their own silly attempts at homiletics.  Don't waste your money.  Pass this one by.
 Not clever, not funny.  With the amount of talent in this movie, how could someone miss so badly?  This movie is aboslutely one of the worst I have ever seen.
 I should note that I didn't come from a Catholic family, so I'm not in the potential audience for this film.  Never the less, this fact is no excuse for 'Dogma's being as mindbogglingly annoying as it is.  Every character, every damn one of them is agonizingly obnoxious, it's just unbelievable.  Any one of them could cripple a scene all by his or herself, yet there are often many of the on the screen at once.  Take the most involved scene in this film then add in, say, Kathy Griffin and Chris Tucker, and it would cause my head to explode within seconds.  Frankly, I'd probably be better off.  Still, every time this thing comes on TV, which is about every other day on Comedy Central, I can't help but watch a little of it.  I don't know why.  Do I hate myself? Am I a masochist?  Or do I have to prove to myself every time I see it that it's really as bad as I think it is?  Suffice to say, this isn't necessarily the worst movie I've ever seen, but I honestly can't think of a single movie that I HATE more than 'Dogma'.  Grade
 This has to be the worst DVD I ever bought!  Not only was the movie boring, but it was also quite annoying due to the extremely terrible acting -- Ben Affleck and Matt Damen needed to be smacked for their horrid performances in this film.  The only characters that manage to draw any giggles or smiles at all were Jay and Silent Bob, but well... that's been done before already, and it's just not enought to carry the whole movie.  See this movie only if you want to get a good baseline of what bad acting, script and film work are.
 While I am a fan of Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and usually Alan Rickman, and was raised Catholic so I can appreciate some of the jokes, this is close to the worst movie I've ever seen.  It gets one star because some of the performances are good, even if the story is dubious.  Sorry twentysomethings. The poop monster was right out of South Park humor, or perhaps Beevis and Butthead-also not my favorites.  And Alanis Morrisette as God?  Please.
 Both my husband and I came very near to walking out of this film in the theater. Matt and Ben were funny together in the past so we thought this was going to be a real treat. Well, the acting, production values, script, dialogue, intellectual depth - just everything about this thing was severely subpar. I can't believe they're trying to resurrect this piece of crap for new, unsuspecting audiences. Yes, I can believe it. Incredible.
 I wasn't offended by the subject matter of the movie, I was appalled by the writer's sophormoric views on religion. Read the Bible, don't waste your time watching this over rated piece of trash.
 Personally, I am a crude, profain marine.  Until I saw this show I thought nothing could offend me.  This group of usually good actors crosses the line.  I watched this show with a party of twenty-something people---none of them particularly religious---who all wanted to take a shower after watching this sickening show. Unless you aspire to be just like Maralyn Manson, you will wish you didn't watch it.  I consider seeing this movie one of the worst two hours I have ever spent.
 Forget about what your read from people giving this a one star effort because they say its "offensive" or "anti-religious", its a one star effort because we have a great cast here that is wasted on what is clearly Kevin Smith's worst movie. As I watched the first half-hour, I was waiting for something to be funny, and it just wasn't. I was felt like I was wasting my time, so I finally hit the stop button, as I couldnt bear to watch another minute of this snooze-fest. Believe me when I tell you that I find everything amusing, hell I even bust out laughing when watching Spongebob Squarepants. If you are a fan of Kevin Smiths films, please stay away from this one. Go into your collection and watch Mallrats on Clerks again.
 WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW.  THERE IS SO MUCH SWEARING, YOU NEED A LOT OF SOAP JUST TO CLEAN IT UP.  THERE IS NO FUN IN THIS MOVIE AND NO HAPPINESS.  JUST BLOODY SENSELESS KILLING.  THE MOVIE MOCKS THE CATHOLIC RELIGION WITCH IS VERY DISTASTEFUL.  DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE GOOD VALUES.
 This shallow film is but pretentious garbage for the new age crowd who think they've found a profound message in their little crystal beads and yoga books.  Although somewhat creative in terms of plot, the script and acting are about as shallow as the pompous message it seeks to propagate.  The story follows two fallen angels played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon who know a way to return to heaven without God knowing it; thereby proving Her imperfect and bringing an end to Her supposedly perfect creation. Yes, to keep up with modern liberal trends God decided to have a sex change operation for this movie.  A woman named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is called upon by two stoner prophets (Smith and Jason Mewes) to take her safely to her destination to stop God's errant angels.  The blunt messages passing off as subtly symbolic are laughable (i.e. the new Virgin Mary working in an abortion clinic.)  Wow! What creative powers of imagination!  Maybe they should have made their points more subtle such as Jay and Silent Bob using condoms for example or Chris Rock as the 13th apostle being not only married but polygamous.  Why not have the female God get a divorce while they're at it?  But since this screenplay is an attack on Christian hippocricy, why name Matt Damon's  hesitant protagonist character 'Loki' (a mischevious Nordic god having nothing to do with Christianity) while virtually every other character has a biblical name? To appear creative I suppose.  Perhaps the most irritating was Alanis Morissette as God
 Creepy movie for sure but not creepy enough... The film begins out with promise and then falls apart miserably in the final 1/3 of the movie. The ridiculous sub-plot with Danny Glover was embarassing to watch. The 'who dunnit' becomes weak and fails as the writers seemingly ran out of ideas and just slapped together some mess of an ending. At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary - but in the end, the film falls short of its goal.
 Pardon my theft from a classic Easy Money line, but this movie just plain stunk. Saw is a Seven clone but without the heart, soul or intensity of the original psychological thriller. Saw tries in every way to mimic the better aspects of Fincher's masterpiece, the ultra-quick cuts, the psycho who's fed up with the wrongs of society and the no win choice that the main character of this film is left with. Cary Elwes plays Lawrence, a middle aged surgeon who is married with a small daughter. Elwes just doesn't have the grit needed to pull off this grimy, dirty, angry role. He's too much of a pretty boy and you can see right through his rantings and ravings as ultra-scripted. The plot twists a number of times but the ending has to rank among the worst I've ever seen. It leaves the viewer angry and feeling hollow, besides this, lots of loose ends are never tied up. The premise is what drew me to the film certainly not the star power (or lack of star power for that matter) eventhough Danny Glover does play a cop in search of the killer. Saw is late night cable fare at best and a poor imitation of an original idea (Seven). Not Recommended.
 My husband convinced me to join him at a "sneak" preview of Saw this evening. Well I saw it and all I can say is I haven't laughed that hard since I saw Scary Movie. The only problem is I don't think this was supposed to be a comedy! Was it bad? Oh yeah! Is it worth renting? Oh no!
 Here's the gist...  The creators of this film obviously saw such films as the Usual Suspects and Seven and said "Hey I want to make a movie like that, except not particularly intelligent or inspired in any way.  The vaunted villain is the worst sort in movies like these. They want him to be a genius, but instead of being particularly cunning or intelligent they instead just make everyone else him the movie such an idiot that he's basically allowed to get away with anything. minor spoiler
 There are not words to describe how bad Saw was. Horrific, and not in the scary sense. Hideous. Abysmal. Those merely skim the surface. Where to start?  The Acting
 MOVIE
 This is the perfect example of Hollywood's inability to no longer generate an original thought. This is just a culmination of 12 other movies, one that was good, some that were mediocre, some that were, well, not so good, but the end result is one of the worst movies ever made, it sucked. First off the whole feeling of the film is of one of those low budget, straight to video, serial killer, B movies. The lighting, anywhere else but the bathroom sucked, the acting was below par and frankly sucked, the short 45 sec. car chase scene, was one of the cheapest, cheesiest scenes I've ever seen in my entire life and frankly the editor and the director should be ashamed for having it in the finished product. I mean, just because you shoot a guy in a car with high speed film and make them move around so the finished product is herky jerky and chaotic looking, does not mean that its a cheaper alternative thats just as good, it in fact means that you've achieved to project yet another B grade effect, lending an amateurish prose for your film. The only reason that I gave this movie even a star, was because it does have a surprise ending. Not a thought provoking one like Se7en, which is thought invoking on many moral and ambiguous levels (which I think this director really tried to unsuccessfully imulate), no its just one of those endings where you go, "Oh," and move one with your life and don't give it another thought, unless your retarded and in which case you'll still be talking about it a week after you saw it (in which case you'll inadvertantly talk thousands of intelligent people into watching this (...). This film not only took 2 hours of my life that I will never get back, along with my $3.50 it took to rent it, it also took several IQ points that I would very much like to get back. Now there's an idea for a movie, retarded hollywood directors make crappy films to suck IQ points from viewers, it could be a documentary, not a fictional account, 'cause its happening right now!!! I really can't tell you why I even picked this up off the shelf at rental place. Guess I just wanted a little escapism. Well I didn't even get that. But I'll tell you what I did get, one lame ass movie.
 I'm probably going to get my share of flack from others on this site after they read this review, but I'm going to voice my opinion anyway.  I'm being completely honest in everything I say here.  I just viewed this earlier today at my local theater and it has to be the biggest letdown for me out of all the movies that I have seen this year.  To me, Saw has a weak and uninteresting plotline with a bunch of horrific actors weaved into it.  Cary Elwes was completely unconvincing in this picture (I've never seen him in others, so I'm only going by his performance here) When the film first started, I wasn't getting into it then, but I decided to wait it out, hoping that things would pick up by mid picture, but sadly to report, it did not.  I wasn't scared at all, I was disinterested.  I was so bored, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.  I wasn't the only one.  I was the only one left in the theater because everyone was walking out (I never walk out of films, but I REALLY wanted to).  I heard one comment as a dad and his son were exiting
 I believe this film had promise--at least in the beginning however it quickly descends into a horrific mess with tons of plot holes and a premise that is just shy of absurd.  Danny Glover is totally wasted and it's hard to believe he even did this movie.  Avoid.
 I originally intended to watch Saw in the theatres to get the full effect that I thought I could get from such a movie. Thank god I didn't waste my money. Now usually I'm a pretty easy going critic of scary movies. But this one I just couldn't appreciate no matter how hard I tried. As far as the plot line goes, it wasn't too bad. The fact that its been done a million times, the bad guy trying to teach "innocent" people lessons, is getting a little played out. The aspect of the movie which I could not get over was the HORRIBLE acting. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell over acted so much that it seemed funny. Even Danny Glover, who played a disjointed cop, was unconvincing. It got to the point that I was wishing someone would stop playing games with him and just put ME out of my misery by killing both of them. Now not to take anything away from the plot because I actually thought it was still creative even after being done a million times before. I also liked James Wan use of lighting and how he kept things a little abstract and dark so that we couldn't get the whole picture until the end. Now Saw 2 is in pre-production and I can only hope the casting director will step up and get some really good actors so we can all enjoy the "Jigsaw Killer's" next little game!

 Ok, this movie is so stupid. It is not a scary movie AT ALL. It was boring, predictable, and only had a few moments that were really suspenseful. I can't believe that there's been three sequels from this movie. I mean, come on!!
 I gotta say, when I went to see this movie, I was expecting something different. From the ads, I figured it was going to be a hardcore psychological thriller with a hearty dose of the old ultraviolence to keep things moving along.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Saw is actually not a thinly veiled takeoff of "Se7en at all! Rather, it's a tongue-in-cheek parody of the genre. Or at least, I think it was. I wasn't too certain after a while--that's how closely they walk the line with this movie.  After the initial genre confusion wore off, I found it a very enjoyable film indeed. Ask the guy two seats ahead of us, who kept turning around to tell me off for laughing.  Don't be turned away by the promises of sadism and gore--they're in this film, in spades, but they aren't the focus of the movie itself. Yes, it's bloody and overblown. But it's more than that--it's a total laff riot. From the Insane Black Cop to the Adorable Little Girl In Peril, this movie has it all. It's a veritable cornucopia of cheesy cliche and saw-it-coming-a-mile-away plot twists.  Imagine "Se7en put to slamming metal music, filmed in some guy's semi-finished basement with a dirty 80 watt bulb to light the room, and you have Saw.  Cary Elwes plays an extremely convincing role as a self-mutilating albino grub-man with tiny pretty eyes. The Adorable Little Girl In Peril debuts with authenticity and passion, but you'll find the scenes stolen again and again by that lovable scamp, Mr. Dead Guy On The Bathroom Floor.  I think the author of the original script is in this movie as well, but I didn't see much of him because I spent a good 2/3 of the movie balled up on the sticky theatre floor, giggling helplessly while an usher nudged me angrily with the tip of his shoe.  Bottom line
 If you haven't seen "Saw" (or is that sawn "See"?), don't read this. What a shame, because the ending deserves a better movie. I can suspend disbelief ("X-Files" comes to mind), but this film is insulting in its conceits. The convenient coincidences and the maddening stupidities piling up at the end reminded me why I bailed out of the Fox TV show "24" early in its first season. How does Jigsaw lay motionless for hours? Why does Dr. Gordon saw off his foot when the saw was long enough to reach the cell phone? He's a doctor. He couldn't tie a better tourniquet to keep from bleeding to death? How does Jigsaw know so much about so many people? How did Jigsaw lower Adam into the tub, then have time to position himself in the middle of the room before the water roused Adam? Dr. Gordon was awake when Adam regained consciousness, so why wasn't he aware of the presence of Jigsaw? If there was a lapse of time between putting Adam in the tub, Jigsaw postioning himself in the center of the room and Dr. Gordon waking up, then how did Adam not drown in the tub to begin with? If you've been given a "slow-acting" poison that you know will take hours to kill you, why not go to the hospital? A poison expert could narrow down the possibilities (how many such poisons actually exist?) and administer the antidote. Your 8(?) year-old daughter tells you there's a man in her bedroom and you don't search the room just to prove there isn't? Your wife disarms the "killer" then doesn't shoot him, especially when he's seated two-feet away from your daughter who is still tied-up? The daughter cries out, of course mom is distracted and of course the "killer" disarms her. How does the "killer" escape, travel to the remote location, negotiate the catacombs and get to the room where Adam and Dr. Gordon are located as if he's been there many times before? How did Jigsaw get Dr. Gordon's penlight? Once it was determined that Dr. Gordon had an alibi, why wouldn't the police start checking into his patients or hospital employees, since Jigsaw was clearly someone who had access to Dr. Gordon? This is only scratching the surface. Watch the "Making of.." featurette on the DVD (which was also pretty weak) and you'll see that this was a great idea in search of a story. And these guys are getting the chance to make "Saw 2?" Oy vey!
 I don't expect much out of horror films these days, but as a gigantic fan of the genre, I subject myself to most decently buzzed-about films that are classified as horror. First off, very few films catagorized as horror films these days are. "Scream" is not a horror film; it is a mid-nineties FOX show with suspense and a killer. "Saw" is also not a horror film, in fact, it should not have been a film at all. Cary Elwes deserves some sort of award for the worst over-acting ever committed to film (put it right up there with his portrayal of Ted Bundy in "The Riverman" and we may have the worst actor of today on our hands), the script reads like it was written by a middle-school kid daydreaming out the window about one day killing the lunch recess bully, and the visuals are god-awful( the car scene narrowly beating out the cut-to-flashback format of the first two killings. Ever since that other tremendous film "Sixth Sense", we seem to always have to have the surprise ending in every horror film, as if it is a prerequiset for the film to be made. Very rarely is this ending a surprise; here it is no different. The difference is, this ending makes absolutely no sense. There was no preperation, no thorough introduction of the character and then no identification as to real motive. This is a film made by amateurs, and it shows. Whoever green lit this peace of trash, should not be allowed that respondsibility again. This film attempts to be clever, to make you think. What it achieves, though, is completely opposite. It is films/"art" like this that help to create a less intelligent society.
 Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value. I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema. I just read someone reviewing "Hostel part 2" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic "Silence of the Lambs", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to). Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and concidered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society??? If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plummer working, that would be more entertaining than this trash anyday. And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there. Thank you.
 (This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.)  Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out, because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.  Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it scary, and the situations hardly made it scary, therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.  Not even the gore could've saved the plot, and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.  Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.  Oh, did I mention poor acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance; however, this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too played-out, although not as bad as the performance by Elwes, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.  The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it, and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted, and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.  I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the $4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot, it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this
 "Saw" is a badly acted movie with spotty writing and odd direction. The characters aren't believable and the twist at the end is even more unbelievable. Nothing rings true, unless you like gore for gore's sake.  This is not a horror movie in my opinion. It's simply a horror.
 I saw this movie for the first time on the SciFi channel. It is so poorly filmed that it could've been a made-for-tv movie. They must have had a very low budget to make it.
 I was told by several people at work that this was the best horror movie that they had seen in a long while.  Based on their opinions, I went and bought the special edition.  After viewing 'Saw' I came to the conclusion that it was one of the silliest movies, horror or otherwise, that I had seen in quite some time.  Firstly, it's not scary in the slightest.  Gory does not equal scary in my book.  Also there were several unintentionally funny scenes in the movie.  The silly mask that 'Jigsaw' wears was just one thing that made me laugh.  If you're a connoiseur of horror movies as I am, I would recommend 'Saw' for a good laugh but nothing else.  I don't think I'll listen to the people I work with anymore.
 I should apologize for such a bad joke but it's appropriate here.  Saw stands alone as the only film this year in which, at the end, I was wishing for horrible things to happen to all the cast members and anyone connected with this monstrosity, I exempt the little girl who was too young to know any better.  Like all truly horrible experiences, this film was just intriguing enough to get me in the door, and then to keep my attention for a little while, I can forgive much in a film, especially when the filmmakers are walking such familiar ground.  Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Copycat, Kiss the Girls, The Bone Collector and on and an and on, we have seen this formula many times, most recently with "Taking Lives", all these films have much in common.  We have a serial killer who is, by necessity, crazy and brilliant, he either A. Has someone who is going to die/be killed if the hero does not solve the mystery B. He will strike again unless the hero solves the mystery.  Pick one.  With so many other films like this I don't expect big surprises, but I was wrong.  This was surprisingly, maddeningly, excruciatingly bad, really bad.  As if it weren't enough that we had a familiar story line, the producers of this bile had to handle it like a paint by numbers game.  The cop who is after the killer has all the newspaper clippings from the case taped to the walls of his crappy little studio apartment.  Why?  So the audience can read them of course, also because it is a tired clich&eacute;.  Like all bad cop movies, there is the convenient "abandon" building, the building that serves no purpose except for chasing bad guys around, and of course it is conveniently empty except for the cast.  This film takes place in one of those strange worlds where people can fire guns around and drive like maniacs and no one ever calls the police, even the police don't call the police.  At least 5 times the villain is in the crosshairs and he is let go by acts that would embarrass the three stooges, Scooby doo and the gang would have done better.  Then there is the terrible contrived acting, the players seem to be in some sort of acting workshop where they are told, off camera, "all right now cry and plead"..."good, now lets put on our angry face", everything happens because the screenplay needs it to, there is not reason to care about any of the characters and I have never, in recent memory seen a film where I was so completely angry with virtually everyone on screen, the pay off at the end was ludicrous and maddening, there was no reason for anyone to suffer through this mess.  If my leg were chained to the theater floor I might have been tempted to saw through it rather then see this crap.
 First of all, If I could give this movie negative stars I would. Secondly, If I had the choice of seeing this movie again, or bashing my head in with a big blunt object, I would grab the biggest rock I could find and smash away. This movie is a disgrace, and I'll tell you why I think this in a second. Before I go any further though, let me just say that this movie does have some very morbid and graphic torture scenes, and it does have a few good scenes to make you jump, but that's about it at the very least. Now, I hate this movie for so many reasons that I can't even keep count, but mostly because it wasn't what I expected it to be, or what they hyped it up to be on the previews. If you're looking for a horror or scary movie to watch this definitely isn't the movie for you, but if you need a good laugh it's perfect. Afterall, I laughed my head off because some of that stuff was so cheesy. I don't really think the budget was really the major problem because there have been some brilliant movies that had small budgets, but I do think this movie was just written terrible. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the concept of this movie, but what I can't appreciate is the shabby way they put this movie together, and then smacked us in the face with that horrible ending. I'm sorry to spoil the ending for you if you haven't been fortunate enough to see this movie, but I gotta say that having an old man that was already dying turn out to be the insane killer at the end was pure GENIUS! I wonder who's bright idea that was. I felt so cheated by the time the movie ended I just sat there looking at the credits going they can't be serious. For crying out loud, they could've just kept the hospital orderly the killer if that's the best that they could do, and even that was too far-fetched. I could bash this movie all night long, but the last thing I have to say is that I had a choice in seeing this movie, or watching "The Grudge", and I wish I would have picked the other movie.
 This was probably one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched, especially with all the hype surrounding it.  My friends insisted that this was a horrifying movie, and they were right- just not in the way I expected. The only horrifying thing about this movie is the acting done by a tired and bloated looking Cary Elwes.  Past that, the movie just doesn't make any sense.  And so far as the plot twists that so impressed my friend, they're juvenile and easy to guess or just silly.  Wait for this one to come out on a premium cable channel and save your money.
 I rented this and what can I say? Well... you can't use that type of language here at Amazon but I'll just go with it...  Awful acting? Check.  Awful story? Check.  Awful direction? Check.  Awful villian? Check.  Awful chemistry? Check.  Awful ending? Check.  To have this movie as a 3.5 star average and to even have ONE five star rating is a crime against God, humanity, and cinema... and maybe not in that order. If you are the brainless sort that finds Fear Factor to be "good television" then by all means, buy this NOW.
 For what is supposed to be a horror movie, I did not find it scary at all.  Instead I found it annoying and boring.  The two actors are either wrong for the roles or just did not know what they were doing.  What were they thinking when they made this ugly movie?
 Saw is one of the worst psychological thriller/horror film I have seen since Kiss the Girls.  It is pseudo-Harrision, tedious, and the writers obviously did not dwell in the research department for long while writing the script.  The plot is outlandish, unbelievable, and ultimately retarded.  Not only would a person not go to the great lengths and means to achieve his ends depicted in the film, but a person could not plausibly do any of the exaggerated actions depicted in the film.  I have heard many people say that this is the most disturbing film they have seen in a long time, and I can agree with that so long as they are disturbed by the fact that this film was actually made.  In a nutshell, Saw was a complete and utter waste of time.
 This movie is seriously a joke! The editing is horrificly bad, the set design is way over the top. . . I mean come on, how could ever square inch of every "scary" room have "perfect" lighting?! It's ridiculous. Cary Elwes gives his absolute worst performance ever. . . . and compared to the films he's done, I guess this would be his best. He, as well as every character in this huge blunder, is completely unbelievable, and the production is as good as a middle school talent show. I cannot believe Hollywood puts as much funding as they do into material this atrociously bad. Shame on you if you waste any of your life on trying to dive into the mess-up called "Saw" This movie was a waste of time and energy. Filled with pointless, disturbing violence, it was made only worse by a flakey storyline and irritating characterisation. It just made no sense! Come on! a sick man in hospital organising gruesome killings so that the victims learn to appreciate life. Then he's lying still for over 7 hours pretendng to be dead (the guy with his brains blown out) so he observe his victims. Then at the end of the film he walks out of the room. This movie was sick, and I suspect only sickos would appreciate it. Why isn't it possible for people to ban these kinds of movies in the first place, - that glorify filth, murder & moral degeneration? An ungenerous review for a morally depraved and ungenerous film.
 One of the worst movies i have ever seen!  I saw this movie in theaters, and almost walked out.  If I hadnt had payed for the ticket, I would have.  The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen and the script doesnt help at all.  Most of the "scary" parts will just make you laugh, because you do not develop even the slightest connection to any of the characters whatsoever.  The methods of killing are mediocre at best, and, like most horror movies, the intelligence level of the lead characters is very low.  The one redeeming factor of this movie is the ending, which is the only part I enjoyed.  I expeced better.  Thumbs down.
 I rented this one to see if it was actually as bad as the premise would suggest.  It was.  Not only did I feel sick while watching this movie, I felt nauseous for the rest of the day.  I'm not talking about a squeamish kind of nausea; my stomach is a strong as they come.  I felt disgusted with myself for actually having watched and sat through this dog.  Sadly, there was a time in my teens when I would have absolutely loved this flick.  PS-- I also felt cheated by the image of a rotary saw blade on the dvd, when all they used were cheap hacksaws... big difference.
 Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it.
 A pointless plot, bad acting and the typical Hollywood formula for teeny-bopper horror movies. The ending made the movie go from crap to MAJOR crap. This movie is very scary and disturbing - for 3rd graders....  You want disturbing?  You want to be freaked out for weeks after a movie?  Try out some of the best, most disturbing work anywhere - look up director Takashi Miike on Amazon, then try out Audition, Gozu, Ichi, etc.  But for all those who thought SAW was scary and disturbing, then forget it - you couldn't handle Miike.  Try Sesame Street.
 How does anyone say the Saw movies are better than Hostel,these movies don't deliver anywhere near the amoount of carnage that movies like Hostel and Wolf Creek do. These movies are soft enough for elementary kids to watch. The gore doesn't match up to Hostel and the story doesn't match up to Seven. This movie doesn't deliver on either level its suppose to.
 This movie works for about 45 minutes, then takes a horrible nose dive with some truly ridiculous plot twists. AND I was SO happy when Danny Glover got massacred in this movie. I actually stood up and clapped. Any detective who has his gun on the killer and doesn't get him, then loses him AGAIN after obsessing over the crime to the point of insanity, deserves to die. This movie was really dumb. Bad writing, bad acting (now we know where has-been actors like Cary Eiwes go to die). What a waste.
 I saw this movie with a friend of mine the other night and I have to admit I was really looking forward to it.  I was told that it was a bit gory but it had a good plot and the ending was good as well.  WRONG!!!  This movie had poor acting as well as a very dark plot.  There is nothing happy or satisfying in this movie.  In the end, you feel very cheated and wish you had the last 100 minutes of your life back.  If you are looking for a good thriller, do not see saw!
 I had high expectations about this movie.  It's a psychological thriller where the Jigsaw Killer essentially forces his victim's to die or kill the other person in the room with them.  This movie was a huge disappointment.  It was not smart, not well acted, not a good plot.  I just didn't find it plausable, especially the ending. I guess you'll have to judge for yourselves, but two feet down for me. The rest of this review contains spoilers.  *SPOLIER ALERT*  Here are some of my problems  1. The guy lying on the floor the whole time and they didn't know he was alive.  Plus he has tape player in one hand, gun in the other, and electruction button where? Sorry not buying it.  2. You don't know if Dr. Gordon lives or dies.  3.  The guy kills Adam for losing the game.  I didn't know he was playing a game.  What was it?  I thought Dr. Gordon was playing the game.  4.  The orderly who is "innocent" and kidnaps the wife and kid decides to hold a stethoscope to their hearts to hear their fear but he's not even the bad guy.  Stupid.  5.  The bad guy is terminal and in the hospital but he is perfectly fine when it comes to building the face-ripper-aparter and barb-wire maze.  6.  The whole thing about Adam taking pictures of Gordon and that's how they wound up together. Retarded.  7. Danny Glover and his parter have the bad guy.  Danny Glover is pointing a shotgun at him, the partner is trying to stop the head-drilling machine.  The partner shoots the drills.  Somehow this distracts Danny Glover and the bad guy gets away.  What the f***?  That's so stupid.  Then the bad guy gets shot in the back with a shotgun then gets up and runs away.  Brother.  8. Finally, I just couldn't buy into the fact that Gordon would saw his foot off.  Even at one's most irrational point you have to know it'll take like half an hour to saw through the bone and then you'll bleed to death, and then you don't know where they are so you won't get to them for who knows how long.  Plus, wouldn't you pass out before you could saw your foot all the way off.  Anyway  P.S.  I have to credit some of these points to earlier reviews, they're not all mine.
 Lame. This movie debuts at #1 on the 2004 Craplist. It tries to much to be like "Seven" and "The Usual Suspects" and falls short of even effectively duplicating the plot twists and surprises of those two films. I wanted both my time and money back. I would escape by sawing MY leg off if I was chained to a floor in a dank room and forced to watch this movie over and over again.  And if you didn't pick up on what was going to happen in the first five minutes, like what the title meant, then you're an idiot who provides a market for brainless films with bad acting and sensationalized plots and idiotic violence. I'm sorry, but this movie SUCKED!
 I can understand when someone likes a film for reasons others may hate it, and sometimes acting, mood, lighting, sound, and direction all make a huge effect on someone's opinion of something. I believe anything could be better than this 'film', even cutting myself to pieces and filming it would be more fun than this crap!  Danny Glover stars in this. I had to check the main Amazon page to verify that sense I don't own this crap. Isn't that a shock in the rubber parts??!! To think at one time he was doing such GREAT work in classics like "The Color Purple" to sink to doing this. Wow, what a downfall!! I think Danny Glover needed the money. I was embarrassed for him! And, I thought he was embarrassing in "Gone Fishin", but this is the bottom of the barrel. This is unwatchable garbage.  Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.  This isn't 'horror', nor is it a 'film', but disgusting pieces of footage combined together to whet a poor filmmaker's egotistical fetishes and air them in public for all to see; and, what vile carnal garbage this is, at that. Bilge like this should be flushed down the toilet, along with the people who made it. I couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes of this crap. It isn't merely disgusting, it's PRETENTIOUS JUNK that's pretending to be "art", when in reality it has NOTHING to say or add to the world...except maybe provide viewing pleasure for people who get off on watching torture. And THAT'S scary. We've sunk pretty low. These are some sorry individuals who made this!  The scariest thing is indeed the fact that so many people love this crap. Some are starting to call it "torture porn", meaning that it's pornography for people who love violence, not sex. I think that's an apt description.  These movies are inhuman. People, mostly kids and young adults, are paying good money to enjoy watching inhuman acts. Society is becoming like "Lord of the Flies". And the people who are the sickest are the least likely to see it in themselves, apparently.  I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.  I read someone reviewing "Hostel part 2" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic "Silence of the Lambs", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to).  Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and considered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society???  If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plumber working, that would be more entertaining than this trash any day.  And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there. Thank you.
 I'll keep it simple.  This is a trite and contrived attempt and making a thriller.  Basically the entire movie is stolen from previous thrillers like Seven.  The characters are boring and the acting is comically bad.  Danny Glover and the rest of the cast should be ashamed of themselves.  If you're like me you'll be hoping everyone dies at the end.  I love how people we're going on and on about how gross the movie was.  It was so weak. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie.  Save yourself the time and money.
 When the acting is so hideous that you want EVERYONE to die, it's really hard to find a movie appealing. If you really want a scare, watch Black Christmas. The writers should be ashamed of this trash.
 (Spoilers)  Oh man, remember that movie Se7en? That was a classic. So good it just cries out for a remake. Only, instead of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, let's see if we can't get Cary Elwes and Danny Glover, both of whom are available for a slice of pie. Also, let's take the taut, inexorable logic of the original and turn it on its head... sorry, DROP it on its head, removing all wit and sense. Throw in a puppet and a dirty bathroom and BAM! You got yourself a half-a**'d movie, my friend!  SAW actually starts out promising enough. The director throws you into things in media res with Elwes and Some Dude awakening to their surprise in the aforementioned toilette, chained to some pipes that are probably non-functional, but sufficiently atmospheric in a Godsmack video kind of way. Naturally, questions abound. How did they get here? What diabolical madman would do such a thing? How come there's no toilet paper? You get the idea.  Come to find out, Elwes is an oncologist, and these two clowns are at the mercy of one of his cancer patients. That's right, a guy with Stage IV colorectal cancer arranges to capture, kidnap, and torture able-bodied guys half his age. As someone with Stage III colorectal cancer myself, I gotta say, my man gets around!  Would you like a run-down of SAW's 700 other plot holes? Or a sneak peek of its preposterous 'surprise' ending? I didn't think so. Suffice it to say that you get a couple of Se7en's elaborate death traps, but you don't get the moral irony behind them. You don't even get a lot of scare or even gore for your dough. Your biggest fear is that the film will never end!  Props to the puppet, though.
 I purchased this item at a very good price but when I got it , it wasnt what the picture said it was.
 This movie is about some crazy guy nicknamed Jigsaw who kidnaps people and tries teach them lifes values, by putting them through sick twisted games.What the heck is that all about?!It is nothing but blood and gore throungh the whole movie! If I could give this movie 0 stars I would,it sucks!
 You heard me! This movie sucks. Everything about it is stupid. This film is disgusting. It is polution to your mind to watch this. Stay away.
 "Cube" is much scarier and better made, using a similar idea. Find out what happens to six people who wake up trapped in a mysterious white room that seemingly has no doors. Truly frightening!
 This movie was OK, it was kind of disturbing, but it was OK, The acting of Cary Lewis, I thought, was pretty bad. I really, really, did not like the ending. Other people who I have talked to said this movie was dumb, and I agree with them. The people who thought this movie was good, you obviously have no good taste in movies and believe me, I know movies, and I know when or when not to recommend them to people and this is one that I would not recommened.
 Let's face facts, if you are dying to see this film I won't change your mind. This review is for those on the fence. A lot of the five star reviews talk about the low budget and twist ending so let's address that first. It is VERY apparent that a film has a low budget when the boom microphone is visible in approximately 8 shots in the movie. About five of which are in the opening minutes of the film (pay attention to "Adam" because that black spot above his head is not a film flaw). I saw this in a dollar theater so perhaps they have made enough money to digitally erase it from the DVD (if not those wacky college kids have a new drinking game-"take a shot for every time the boom mic appears"). Those boring hyper-cool quick cut flashy strobe like filming sequences that some of us remember being trite in the prime of MTV's "headbangers ball" days are over used and only make the film that much worse. They become especially ridiculous during a car chase sequence (why not just do a few quick cuts back and forth). The final "twist" ending involving the killer's identity is on some level morally off even to those not easily offended. They should have sat the killer down for a good viewing of "Ikiru". It did surprise me... in the sense that it had no real logic to it. Other than that, the two name actors (Elwes and Glover) phone it in. Probably because they saw the dailies and decided to just collect a pay check (everyone has to eat). The script is like a mix of "Fear Factor" and Donald Kauffman's writing before his untimely demise in "Adaptation". It provided me with many laughs as a whole and Mike (as the boom mic came to be known after sooo many appearences) made for a good running joke. However, in my meager two cents worth of opinion the people that are hailing this as genius are the same people that make movies like "Final Destination 2" commercial successes.
 do not waste your time or money on this juvenile,lame-a** plot,piece of trash. if i was about,say..13,14, i'd say "cool man,that was gory",not caring about plot. but i'm 30yrs past that. i do love blood&guts so....but GD, there HAS TO BE A STORY LINE. anybody who liked this should think the"faces of death" tapes are the ultimate. put this one straight in the roundfile.
 la verdad que esto es un insulto para las personas...una pelicula...por demas sangrienta....con un argumento...terrible...pesimas actuaciones....realmente..hubiera preferido .. no verla  salduos
 This film was stupid. What a let down. Looked very good in the trailers. Saw sucked!!!!!
 THis is one of those movies that does not play it fair. What this kind of movie does? It's simple. It catches you attention by means of a clever and intelligent first act, then goes to unlimited plot twists and clever editing that makes your brain gets numb and you will feel that you are watching a great movie, that you are being entertained. Then, some minutes after the movie ends you suddenly ask yourself
 Wow, movies today are getting more repulsive and disgusting by the minute. No wonder we have so much teenage violence. This movie goes way too far as far as blood and gore goes. I mean, we dont need to watch some guy sawing his leg off and getting shot in the head. Directors are just trying anything they can to get a rise out of people these days, its pathetic. Save your money.
 (big time spoiler) This is one of those movies that you hear everybody calling it the best horror movie in the long time, but actually suck. This is one of those Blair Witch Project movies that you wait 1 �or 2 hours for something to happen but at the end the whole movie goes down the drain. A guy cuts his arm off (and doesn't bleed to death). A very young girl is gagged and the camera insists on her cries and suffering (which is so wrong), and at the end the killer gets away (who by the way didn't have any reasons to do what he did). This movie is so DUMB I couldn't believe my eyes. If you are a horror fan like me, try
 SAW 2 IS COMING OUT.. IT'S CALLED  SAW 2 
 Cary Elwes doesnt even deserve to be making films - this movie was just terrible and I could not believe how bad the acting was.  The concept was good and in better hands - it couldve been an okay film - but in this case a laughable farce that shouldve gone straight to video.  Definitely deserves to be in a list for the top 10 worst films - it would almost be the top of my list.
 The movie starts out kinda good (first 1/2 hour). Gets lost in the middle with Danny Glover running around for no reason. His character in the movie seemed pointless and reminded me in a small way of Glover in Predator 2 (sweaty and bloody, but not in as good of shape). Anyway, the acting was horrible (Cary was the WORST) and the ending was VERY predictable. If you bought this before DO NOT buy it again! If you didn't buy the first release do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this one either. Severed thumbs way down!!!
 This movie is horrible.  Its not even worth 1 star.  This plot is so overused, I mean if you like this at least watch Seven you might view Saw differently, I could tell a couple college kids wrote it in 2 weeks its a simple formula for money which is a big part what the movie industry is about, but comon now.  But I am going to give it a star, not as a horror movie but a comedic attempt at a horror movie, some of the scenes are friggin hillarious in retrospect, recommended for a good laugh.
 u offered the saw blood cover with pics and all of it said u had it than sent the one with reg cover dont like the way your company does biz.
 this film is doesn't make sense, so it starts where two guys are locked up, it's doesn't build up at all, there already there at the beginning. I like certain things to build up, not cut to chase that soon, but I don't like certain things to build up too long, it's got to be just right. terrible ending, worse than "War of the Worlds"  Ed Wood probably made better thrillers than this bloodbath crap. how does movie even in a genre, it's not horror nor suspense, it's bloodbath crap. Cary Elwes what happened to great lines like "hey great gift dad" I have seen the UK version of this DVD, the quality is terrible, as bad as the oldest VHS, chroma bleed and noise destroyed that DVD.  I can only hope that the US encoders do not use the same ratty old VHS to master from that  the UK people obviously used.  This is complete shame as this is one of  Hoppers' great manic moments, the tension present in the film is ever  present and awesome.  5 stars for the film, none for the UK encoding
 I suppose that most of you who are contemplating on purchasing this DVD version of Lynch&#65533;s BLUE VELVET will have already seen the film. This isn&#65533;t exactly a window-shopper&#65533;s item. Therefore this is just a comment on the DVD and not the film. You can read my thoughts on the film elsewhere on this page, if you&#65533;re interested. The film is presented in fullscreen (4 
 and that's about all it has.After reading countless reviews for this i gave it a try..needless to say it did not impress. The cinematography is exceptional...however it is relied upon to heavilly...this movie was like looking at a shiny penny,at first it dazzles then you realize it is just a penny. lynch seems to prefer style over substance as every scene could be a still picture(then be called art),but in trying to evoke a story he relies on the viewers ability to read between the lines and hoping that the pretty colors will be enough to make the B-movie writing thought-provoking. If you feel like zoning out for awhile,looking at some pretty colors and giving your brain a little rest then rent this. other than that there are numerous movies out there that rely on sound writing and stories than visual flair.
 Someone needs to tell David Lynch that the way to get subtlety and metaphors across to your audience is not to hit them over the head with it. Blue Velvet is brilliantly acted by nearly all involved, with the exception of Laura Dern, who manages to deliver one of the worst performances I have seen in a long time. One of the chief ways of making Blue Velvet an effective movie was for the director, Lynch, to make a noticeable difference between scenes in light and scenes shrouded in darkness. This would convey the theme of what lies beneath suburban America. However, in the light scenes, the dialogue is so ridiculously contrived, that it is impossible to care at all about the characters involved. Here, Lynch has made a movie with something to say, unfortunately the way in which he says it is uninteresting and at times, pitiable. The actors in this film are excellent, and to me represent the only reason anyone should ever see this movie. The characters created by Rosselini, Hopper, and Mclachlan are played with genuine feeling and emotion, something rarely seen in modern cinema. These actors, however, are left with a script that is struggling to make sense of itself. Many have said that Blue Velvet is one of the most significant films ever made. If Lynch had managed to pull of a halfway interesting approach to a fascinating theme, I might be inclined to agree. However, the script is atrocious, the direction and technical aspects of the film poor, and the story, honestly, is not at all interesting. Some reading this review will charge that I simply  ;didn't get the film ;. The problem isn't that I didn't  ;get ; it--I did--but that the film was so poorly made that by the end, I just didn't care.
 Some have found this movie to be daringly shocking.  The only shocking thing that I found about this movie is that some many great actors let themselves participate in such a bad movie.  At the start of this pointless film, it seems interesting and full of suspence, but it soon becomes overly melodramatic and the plot becomes boring.  If you like dry, poorly made movies that have no qualities of redemption, this is the movie for you.  If you have any amount of self respect, stay far away from this film.
 Blue Velvet has got to be one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It started off o.k. but when we first see frank booth it just gets weirder and weirder. The film also suffers from bad script. The acting in the film is very poor expect Dennis Hopper. There are so many films like this and I can't understand why people think this one is so special. I was really looking forward to watching this when I bought the DVD but after watching it I felt cheated into buying a poor film. Overall bad film, bad acting and bad script. People who appeciate those three should steer clear.
 This movie is about coming of age and the loss of innocence. It deals with the dark and sunny side of life.  Kyle MacLachlan is very pure by the beginning of the film but at the end is corrupted or grown up.  He has to  take over and be man because his father is sick. Lynch contrasts the  blue-eyed Sandie with the dark Rossellini character.  This ideology is  great. We get a contrast between the innocent and the corrupt. Blue Velvet  is a coming of age story, that deals with a fantastic and surreal world.  Some of the sequences are truly memorable, especially the one involving  Dean Stockwell singing.  In the end, however, the film is a complete  failure.  There is no plot and teh characters are not at all interesting.  We are given twisted images of sex adn violence but nothing is explained.  This is a very cold and meaningless piece of work.  Lynch is rebelling  against the conventions of film making but through his poor plot and  meaningless characters also alienates us the viewer.
 David Lynch is a man commonly praised as a genius of bizarre imagery and stories. Well, "Blue Velvet" is the only one of his films I've seen, and while I'd still like to see several others, it most certainly turned me off of him quite a bit.  The film follows Jeffrey (MacLachlan), a curious small town boy who discovers a human ear in a field. This causes him to enlist the object of his desire (Dern) to help him investigate and uncover a strange mystery involving a masochistic lounge singer (Rossellini) and a psychotic pervert named Frank Booth (Hopper).  Though the film featured horrible acting from (almost) the entire cast, ridiculously stupid dialogue, and an extremely corny-looking fake bird (don't ask), I think what really bothered me was Lynch's script. It seemed full of contrived plot twists and insanely over-the-top characters meant only for shock value and nothing else (e.g. a laid-back cross-dresser with a fetish for aged overweight women). He seemed to be purposely trying to be bizarre and disturbing, and I really didn't find the film to be much of either. It seemed like your run-of-the-mill "quiet suburbia with a dark side" story.  The film's only redeeming quality is the good performance from Dennis Hopper, but the man is a reliable actor. He did the best that could be done with his role, which was over-the-top and pointless, again, nothing but shock factor.  There are plenty more interesting and well-made films out there about the bizarre and the disturbing, this is one that you really don't need to bother with.  2.5/10
 If you read most of the reviews you'd think I'd give the movie the same rating, NO WAY. This movie stinks, and that's putting it lightly. I've heard some call it a "cinematic masterpiece", I don't think so, more like a waste of miles of film. Some say it's one of the best films of the 80's. Wow that's funny, it didn't win an oscar for best picture. It also didn't make the American Film Institute's Top 100 Best American Movies Of All Time list. In the story, a young man finds a severed ear and begins an investigation which leads him through the perverse side of a small town. While he attempts to solve the crime he meets a woman named Dorothy (Isabella Rossellini) who is in a wild relationship with a sadist named Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper. He becomes deeply obsessed with Dorothy even though he already has a girl of his own (Sandy Williams played by Laura Dern).This is a mystery movie with loads of sexual deviance. Seeing it once was enough for me. This is one of those "out in left field pictures". Oh and by the way, I've noticed that most people who give this movie a low rating, get lots of "no" votes on the "was this review helpful" column including myself. That's OK, whoever you people are, can say our reviews aren't good all day long, it won't change the fact that this movie [IS BAD]
 I was really looking forward to seeing this one. I had heard nothing but great things about it, especially Dennis Hopper's disturbing portrayal. Now my only question is, why did Hopper agree to be associated with this trash?  The film makes a bold-but unsuccessful-attempt at delving just under the surface of small-town America. The result is a convoluted, over-acted, downright laughable piece of grade-A garbage. The only reason I gave it one star is that there was no choice for ZERO. A whodunit? How about a whocareswhodunit? Don't waste your time with this. There are more exciting and/or fulfilling things to do in life, like licking stamps or folding socks.
 This movie is so bad, it deserves its own genre. I think I'll call it "film crappe". In the 80s, many gutsy directors experimented with an unconventional style as a response to the straightforward Speilberg formula we all know so well. Some directors were successful while others were just plain clumsy.  Blue Velvet falls solidly into the latter category. It is basically a Hardy Boys Nancy Drew story peppered with a lot of profanity, weird close-ups, and sexual grossness. "Sexual grossness means that these scenes are so unglamorous and disgusting that not even John Holmes could get turned on. Trust me on this; I never thought I'd be yelling at the screen "Put your clothes on, Isabella, for all that's holy! I've seen enough beer belly for one night!  Artistically speaking, Lynch wavers between surreal and stupid. The film begins quite well but quickly degrades as soon as the actors open their mouths. Dialogue isn't Lynch's strong point. He should stick to gore.  I'll give you one example of the film's cheesiness
 If your taste runs towards the morose, then David Lynch's  ;Blue Velvet ; is for you.  Unfortunately, there is little in this widely acclaimed film that makes it watchable or enjoyable.  It's a depressing exercise in non-humanity, and is better left on the shelf.  The director shocks us into thinking his characters have a real raison d'etre, when in fact there is little to explain why they behave the way they do.  A waste of talent, time and critical support.
 I make it a point to see hundreds of films from virtually every genre, and I judge them good or bad primarily on the basis of how convincing the acting is, how believable the plot line, and whether or not the film generally avoids kitsch and cliche.  Like most people, I usually agree with the critics (except when they seem to under- or overrate a film based on colleagues' opinions), and it was Blue Velvet's widely positive reviews that moved me to see it.  I have never been left so convinced of critics' tendency to jump on the overrating bandwagon.  Overall, the film is atrocious, with it's absolutely last-rate acting being its worst feature.  I'll never forget a few of the more glaring examples of hokum, including a scene when McLachlan's character turns to his sweetheart and begs, "Why, Sandy?  Why are there people like (Dennis Hopper's villainous character) Frank in this world? Why oh why?!  Or the numerous instances when Laura Dern's character insists -- through halting sobs -- to go along on Jeffrey's oh-so-dangerous detective missions ("No, Sandy!  It's TOO dangerous!  I care about you TOO much!").  Awful.  Just awful.  The last scene is brief, but it really captures the essence of this film
 One of the worst movies I ever saw.  Dennis Hopper must have been on drugs to have acted in this movie.  It was crap from beginning to end.
 I picked this disc up a couple of months ago at Best Buy, and I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was.  First and most importantly, there's more than one glaring inaccuracy. If you're going to do a documentary about Gettysburg, shouldn't you at least check the basic facts? It was frustrating, to say the least.  So frustrating, in fact, that I've yet to watch the portion detailing Lincoln's post-battle visit to Gettysburg. If the battle portion was any indication, the Gettysburg Address segment was going to be as bad ... or worse.  The ONLY decent feature were the battle maps. When viewed in high definition, they're fairly cool. However, a few maps here and there isn't nearly enough to warrant a purchase. Go with something else ... anything else.
 This documentary is total BS. The facts and opinions are totally wrong. I doubt that whoever was responsible for this have even read a single book on Gettysburg.  Heth's troops opened the battle, not Early's. Little Roundtop was the most important battle feature on the second day, not Culp's hill. Custer did not "Save the Union". Indeed Grant's victory in Vicksburg did more to end the Civil War than the battle at Gettysburg. Had Meade lost there he would have retreated into Washington's inpenetrable defenses and waited for Grant's army to push Lee away from the district. I have read in many books about Gettysburg that Lincoln was livid that Meade did not follow up the battle by persuing Lee. Their statements as to a 'discovery' of a hand written telegram regarding this and subsequent opinions was absurd. Indeed these four "facts" are only the beginning.  Even the material regarding the address was silly.  Avoid this garbage.
 This is a repellent story about an impoverished Victorian entomologist who falls in love with an aristocrat. The only redeeming value of this movie was to depict in what is probably a realistic way the treatment of servants  in that era.
 Total waste of time.  Waited for the ending to somehow validate this moronic movie and only got further into that place where you say to yourself "How did I sit through that whole piece of junk?"  I'd give it about a -3 if they had minus stars.
 Historical epics have been a part of Chinese cinema for a long time, and now that Jackie Chan has grown just a tad too old to pull the insane stunts of his youth, it makes sense that his latest film, his first directorial effort since 1998's Who Am I?, is 1911, a historical drama about the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew China's last imperial dynasty. Released on the 100th anniversary of the revolution and marking Chan's 100th film, 1911 was unfortunately a failure here in the States, where it took home just over $135,000 at the box office is one of the worst films of Chan's career. The problem, is that the film relies too heavily on title cards to explain already convoluted plot points, rendering the proceedings more akin to a history lesson than a piece of entertainment. If you aren't already familiar with the story taking place, you may find 1911 tedious, overlong, and dry, three words you'd never have thought to associate with a Jackie Chan movie.
 In my opinion, this is one of Jackie Chan's weakest movies. The pace of the movie left no room for actor play and character development. Unless someone understands the history of what was happening in China in 1911 (which I do not), it is hard to make sense of what is going on in the movie. There is an attempt to put the explanation and commentary on the screen, but the font is so small, it is impossible to read in regular definition resolution. After watching the movie I have no more knowledge or understanding of what happened in China in 1911. I also could not bring myself to connect with any of the characters.  The biggest thing that just escapes me with this movie, though, is this. Does Jackie Chan really believe that the revolution was a good thing for China and that Communism has anything good to offer? Was the movie a piece of propaganda forced onto him by the Chinese government (which would explain why the movie is so bad)? I just do not get it.
 Disjointed movie. Bad Chinese propaganda linking the 1911 revolution for democracy to the 1949 communist revolution that installed a dictator government. Jackie Chan sold out.
 The DVD version of this film is a nightmare.  When this movie was released I was the night projectionist is a grind house in downtown San Diego, California.  It was so incredibly offensive that I immediately put it in my "Cult Classic" list.  Imagine my horror upon watching the DVD.  The sound track is perfectly horrible and the "editing" is nothing less than a hatchet job, to say nothing of being a close relative to book burning.  The pitiful Pollyannas who did this have completely robbed the film of its impact.  What kind of a world do these people think we're living in anyway?  I strongly advise against buying the DVD in its current state.
 This DVD is Complete Rubbish! No, not because of the Racism, The Klan, Lynchings, etc., but because of the Poor Acting, Film Quality, and Editing. The DVD Producers actually turned this into a PG Rated Fim...Oh, it's still called an "R", but the Lola Falana Rape Scene was Spliced so heavily that it not only fails to move Me emotionally, I would miss it entirely should I blink My Eyes. The Original Opening Scene, Where a Topless Young Black Lady (Jeanne Bell) is tossed around by White Men standing in a Circle is Edited Out as well, the Producers try hard to omit Racially-Charged Scenes, but to do so leaves the Film empty, unfortunately they keep the Redneck Characters intact, the crappy acting from both Marvin and Burton, and a Dull O.J. Simpson, whose own Voice was overdubbed in this Film.....
 This is such an atrociously awful movie that it's a joy to watch. You have  to be aware of the real life events that were ongoing during the making of  "The Klansman." Burton and Taylor were busting up and Burton was  awash in vodka. He arrived in Oroville, California and promptly proposed to  an 18 year Denny's waitress. His costar, Lee Marvin, was also drinking a  bottle a day. Neither was sober for a single syllable of this terrible  movie and their struggles to appear sober make for some hilarious  moments. Burton, as usual, dreadfully overacts and his attempts at a  Southern accent are pitiful, to say the least. Marvin's acting is much  better, but when he has to speak inane lines from a miserable script, he  can't fare much better. This is a great movie to watch with a couple of  beers. If you appreciate a terrible script, crude sets and two major stars  who were drunk out of their minds while filming, you'll love this one.
 I watched the Klansman on my Kindle Fire. I was appalled to discover two first rate actors, Richard Burton and Lee Marvin, as the protagonists. I've seen "disaster zone" movies before and I must say that the Klansman makes the top five! The only reason to watch this movie is to see Burton-Marvin "acting" as part of a sentimental journey into the past... There's nothing else to recommend this complete failure.
 Dire.  By which I mean the DVD which seems to have been authored by someone at home with some free software.  The DVD claims to be 112 minutes long (It says that on the packaging) but it is only 100
 I can't believe two great actors would lend their names to this catastrophe.  It wouldn't even make the B-movie list.  Reviewers said there was a lot of editing out of violence. I can't imagine what could be restored to make this worth anything.  It was cliche-ridden, poorly written and poorly acted. For example Burton's character was supposed to be crippled--Richard Burton hardly ever maintained that simple bit of acting.  The Klan was an evil entity.  Actually more insidious than the film depicts. So much more could have been made out of the story. Even the climactic scene was cut short.  I can't believe it, but the best acting was done by OJ Simpson.  Then there was the penniless white woman who was raped, She had a hair color job and make up that would have cost a month's salary--not convincingly destitute.  Her rape was never cleared up--among several loose threads left dangling.   It was even worse than  the first BILLY JACK from the same era.
 I don't know who was more lubed, Marvin or  Burton.  Lola Falana is the victim of a really brutal gang rape, OJ Simpson is whacking people left and right.  Not even bad enough to be funny.  Hard to believe the same man who directed FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE was involved.  Save your money.
 This is one of my most disappointing blu-ray purchases ever. As you can readily see from multiple sources, this film was shot 1.37
 This video is just horrible!  I bought it because my 18 month old loves Elmo.  Elmo is barely in the video!  After 2 minutes, my toddler walked out of the room.  It most definitely did not hold any interest for her.
 We were disapointed to see this video had very little of Elmo and a lot of Rosie O'Donnell. It really didn't keep me son's attention - and when Rosie broke into song - my son broke into the other room. His other Sesame Street video Let's Make Music keeps him interested even after 40+ veiwings. Elmopalooza lost his interest the first time he saw it.
 Let me start by saying our son is a big Elmo fan, and we think "The Best of Elmo" is tremendous. This DVD starts VERY VERY VERY slowly...and gets worse and worse and worse.  The opening segment takes forever to get through and offers nothing to keep your child's attention or your attention. When the music finally starts, it is disappointing beyond description.  Our son hated it, we hated it, and returned it after 1 abbreviated viewing.  This DVD has nothing to offer for anyone in any age bracket.
 Our family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe 
 Okay, my wife and I couldn't stand it, but my child, who loves Elmo, couldn't sit through it.  Thank heavens for fast-forward.  By the way, who ever told Rosie she could sing?
 But the video is the WORST!!! This video was actually recommended to me and I was so disappointed (and so was my 17 month old son, who lost interest almost as soon as I put it on). As other reviewers said, there are too many adults and not enough Elmo or any of the other muppets. Except for the Rosie segment (which was actually pretty good, but too late in the show),the musical numbers are not appropriate for toddlers, either. They are slickly produced music videos instead of muppets dancing and singing in the studio with the singers, which is what they usually do on Sesame Street. The plot was really dumb and full of inside jokes. I am in the entertainment industry and I did not even like these jokes!... Then there were all these really brief celebrity cameos.... I can't understand how anyone could give this video a good review, but I guess to each his own.
 I rented this from the video store and could not believe my eyes when I saw what a poor quality film it was.  It looks like this is home movie shot with one camera because you constantly see the camera shifting from actor to actor.
 I've enjoyed previous movies that Laz Alonso was in, like "Stomp the Yard, "Fast & Furious, "This Christmas and "Jumping the Broom so I figured, "Hey, I've never heard of this film. He's in really good movies. Let me check it out.  Cons
 Before you consider throwing away money on this atrocious "film," know that the product description is most definitely misleading.  Besides the fact that the film is in no way close to being a "B-film" as mentioned in the product description, this film is not made by Irish or Scotsmen, but actually consists only of Texans.  This movie has no real association with Irish or Scotsmen, and as for the acting it is merely reading lines at a grammar school comprehension level, and the movie would be improved drastically if edited to be a black and white silent movie.  Also, while irresponsibly not mentioned anywhere about this product, it is by far not appropriate for children.  Do not waste your money on this embarrassment, because all you will get is 2 hours and 20 minutes of homophobic jokes and film quality surpassed by high school AV club movies.
 Take your $27 plus shipping and flush it down the toilet.  Perhaps some good can come from the money that you would have wasted watching this rip off.  I am not quite sure that Strangeheart technically qualifies as a movie per se.  I have yet to see a middle school play that was so poorly crafted, written or acted.  Drunk or not, what a pitiful excuse for a movie.  Find something better to do with your time.
 The Anchor Bay version from 2001 is currently the best you can do with this title.  I had high hopes for the new release, but was suspicious based on the awful cover art.  Sure enough, they have a super-low bit rate, are actually zooming on the image in some areas and have problems with no English subtitles on some of the extras (the film is in French).  I've shown the Anchor Bay version to friends in the last few years all of whom have been impressed by this clever caper from 1981.  But when a company comes out with a new version (seven years after the last time Diva was released on DVD)  it deserves a whole lot better than this.  I second the call for the director of the film and whoever owns the rights to get it the heck away from Lion's Gate so Criterion or some decent production studio can take a crack at it.  DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION.
 Diva is one of my favorite international movies with spectacular surrealistic cinematography and French-style action mixed with beautiful  bel canto singing.  Unfortunately, the producers of the DVD version of the  movie really didn't know what they were doing on the audio track which is  mono and seems to suffer from severe compression and distortion  effects.  The effect is that the sound track sounds muffled and  occasionally even  drops out altogether. Unfortunately, the  audio quality is so bad that it  really ruins the movie, and  ultimately makes one want to fast-forward  through Wilhelmenia Fern&aacute;ndez's beautiful singing. What a  shame. Therefore, although I highly recommend the movie, I would  definitely NOT recommend this DVD.  Perhaps the video version or  French-only release is better.
 This DVD is an insult to DVD technology. I have never heard such a bad sound, not even on video tapes. The movies worth is at least 50% sound (who ever saw it). Besides the fact that laguage is french (what I oversaw) this  es my worst DVD experience ever. 1 star is too much.
 Horrid sound that gets worse as the movie progresses.  I'd read the customer comments and bought it anyway.  The sound is so bad at the end of the film that I had to turn the volume up to 9/10ths to hear anything at all.  Instead of enjoying the film I was constantly reaching for the volume control.  By far this is the worst transfer of a film to DVD that I've seen/heard.  If you're thinking of buying, think again or go get a video copy.
 A brilliant film, you really should get a copy, but DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! The video is muddy, it reminds me of the Asian Bootlegs shot in theaters by people with cameras hidden in their coats - ironic no?  The sound is beyond description, distorted, muted, flat , just aweful.  Don't waste you time here, move on to one of the higly rated more recent transfers!
 When McClintock (my fave Wayne movie, by the way) came out on VHS, there was a big controversy because  ;Goodtime ; video released it in such bad shape. About a week after they released it, John Wayne's son who had produced the movie, said that Goodtime had released it without his permission. He then released a much better version. BOTTOM LINE
 The DVD is of very low quality due to the use of an old unrepaired master film. It is also in the pan/scan format for TV. If you want to see this movie in it's best form, watch it on Turner Classic in the cleaned up wide screen format. I give this DVD 2 thumbs down.
 The movie is a classic John and Maureen.  The problem is that the transfer appears to have been done in a theatre, with a video camera using a very old print that has been run hundreds of times.  This gives you images with what appear to be tears, burns and other image reducing faults.  I went back to my old VHS copy to see what the real image was supposed to look like. All in all, one of the worst transfers I have ever seen.
 Horrible picture on this DVD.  The picture was faded, blurring, and out of  sync!  It was awful! I want to get my money back!  BUT there is good news. Now you can get the official authorized version, which we did, and it's excellent.
 First thing I need to say is that this rating is NOT based on the film  itself. This is a wonderul, charming funny movie. However, the quality of  this dvd is very poor. There are lines that move through the picture  occasionally, there are bits of lint and dirt (like in a movie theatre),the  sound is not always crisp, the film quality itself is sometimes fuzzy and  unclear. I would highly recomend taping the remastered version off of TNT  when it comes on, or buying the vhs version ( I believe it's better, but  not having purchased it myself I would be careful before I buy). I do hope  that they will re-release this movie onto dvd in its remastered format. If  they do, it's worth the wait, pass on this one.
 The Delta Entertainment DVD is clearly a pirated product and one of the worst film-to-DVD transfers I've ever seen.  At 50 cents a dozen this DVD would still be a waste of money.  Go with the Wayne Estate authorized version.
 The Good Times version of McLintock was of atrocious quality. It ruined the entire experience. THis version should not be sold unless there is a disclaimer of the poor quality.
 The picture looks like a VHS tape of McLintock if someone taped it on cable in 1987. Terrible picture quality, snowy, blurry, very disappointed
 Great Movie but DO NOT BUY this poorly made copy from Hong Kong/Taiwan. Our bought VHS tape has better picture quality than this DVD version.
 I have the video and the DVD for this movie. My copy of the DVD is horrible. Goodtimes replicated the DVD and it has lines and blurriness throughout. I am a John Wayne fanatic and was very disappointed in the DVD. The video I have is by MPI and it is in much better shape then the DVD. If you plan to buy this movie...WAIT until someone does it right!!
 The quality of this addtion is very poor and it is not near as good as the Family autherized copy.  It is not centered right and some seens are out of focus and I was very disappointed.  I have searched for the better copy and have not been able to find it.  If you have a copy please e-mail me thank you (I have a copy on VHS)
 Goodtimes video has butchered this great movie.  Sometimes the person talking is not in focus or even on the screen.  Some scenes are missing.  I can't take it back for mine was a gift.  Make sure you buy the version authorized by the Wayne estate if you want the real movie with all of the scenes included.  I have that copy on VHS.  Sorry to say I have not yet found it on DVD.
 While this is one of my all time favorites I made the mistake of not reading the reviews of the product.  Horrible video transfer.  Stay away, do not buy.
 We just got this the other day - really looked forward to watching it. My husband & I are big fans of the movie. It was such a letdown. Our old VHS copy is a better quality than this DVD. We thought that the DVD version would be much clearer and better sound quality. That couldn't have been further from the truth. We're very disappointed, and quite frankly disappointed that Amazon is even selling this DVD. Don't waste your money - worst quality DVD I've ever seen.
 This is a terrible DVD.  The company is Goodtimes Home Video.  It was reproduced in Hong Kong or Tiawan.  I'm very disappointed that Amazon.com would be associated with such a piece of junk.
 This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  Now that Amazon is offering 5,000 streaming titles to Amazon Prime members for free, I've been thinking about buying a wireless router and a new Blu-ray player so I can stream to my television.  But I'm reconsidering based on the way Amazon has handled this title.  They're making a poor-quality, blurry pan-and-scan version available for free streaming.  You also have the option of watching a decent-quality print in widescreen, but you have to pay for the privilege.  What a scam.  If this is Amazon's strategy to entice customers into using their streaming service, then I'll stick with buying the titles I want on DVD when they go on sale.
 Seriously poor quality.  I "wish" I had read the reviews on this product before I ordered it!!  It was as if someone had videoed the movie from a TV screen.  The picture color was poor, the images were "grainy", and the film was "scratchy".  I loved the movie when it came out, but this was a very poor quality product.  Amazon should take this off their market.  It reflects poorly on them.....
 This DVD was of VERY POOR QUALITY. The picture was blury,it had alot of static lines,vertical lines & bad sound. I sent it back for replacement & was sent another one of the same poor quality. All that was done was replacing one bad DVD WITH ANOTHER ONE. I would not recommend this version of McLintock.
 This is a horrible copy of the original.  The color is bad throughout the movie.  There are lines in the picture like you would see if you were watching an old home movie.  The widescreen version is much better than this one.
 In my minds eye I have retained this film in all its boisterous, hilarious, non-political correct fun! The available copies of this film, however, suck. I will pay $50 for a decent DVD copy of this gem.
 If you can find it, get the MPI VHS version of this film. That is the official version from the Wayne estate. It is not wide screen but it has been restored magnificently. Video products from  ;Goodtimes ; have never been known for  ;good ; quality. This film is one of John Wayne's best. Go on a quest. Seek out the MPI version. Good Luck!
 We were disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The picture quality was lousy. In some places it was downright blurry. In this day of computerization, I would think the movie could've been "updated" as so many others have been. When our eyes started crossing, we decided to stop watching it. We were sorry we spent our money on it.
 A very bad copy for a DVD, my VHS copy is much better. Some scenes are out of focus. Some frames are off center. I'd look for a better edition.
 If you look at the fine print on this DVD, you'll see that it is not approved by the Wayne Foundation.  And boy does it show.  The image quality of this DVD has all the earmarks of being a DVD recording of a VHS copy of the movie.  They didn't even bother to use a new VHS tape-- judging by the grainy texture and the annoyingly prevalent flaws (flickers, "hairs on the screen, etc) it was captured from an old copy of the tape.  I have a VHS tape that has a better picture than this DVD.  Everyone PLEASE write the Wayne Foundation and tell them about the shoddy release of this movie!  If we make ourselves heard, we might be able to convince them to release widescreen, Criterion quality releases of John Wayne's less famous movies.  UPDATE
 McLintock is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  It is a wonderful tale done by a great group of actors.  The sad day comment is based on the totally pathetic quality of the DVD.  To put is very simply it stinks.  Not  only is it not in widescreen it appears the film they copied it from was  dragged around the parking lot for half an hour then danced on by a herd of  elephants.  I will stick to the VHS version of this movie until someone  who is not out for a quick buck puts out a credible copy of this fine film.  Save your money.  I would have given this insult to John Waynes memory no  stars but the system required that I give it at least one. So that is what  it got.
 It is a toss-up between  ;McClintock! ; and  ;The Quiet Man ; for our all time favorite John Wayne movie, so we were very excited to be able to order them both for our new DVD player.  Re
 DON'T THROW OUT THE VHS!!  I foolishly didn't look in this section and see the previous reviews of the DVD before I bought it.  Bad move.  This DVD is the worst quality DVD transfer I have seen.  I compared the VHS and the DVD at the same time
 The movie is good if not great but the problem was on the GoodTimes video transfer.  The quality of the movie in the transfer was horrible.  At times the picture was ok, but most of the time is was fuzzy and the soundtrack lagged some.  I also have the John Wayne movie  ;El Dorado ; on DVD but not a GoodTimes rendition and the quality of that DVD is excellent.  While I recommend the movie McLintock I do not recommend this GoodTimes version.  Do not waste the money on this one.
 McLintock is a great comedy/western; the casting is perfect and the script intelligent and witty.  However, Good Times Video treated this excellent movie with tremendous disrespect and cheated buyers of this DVD badly.  The ancient Greek saying of  ;caveat emptor ; or  ;let the buyer beware ; fits well here. Anytime you see that the DVD comes from Good Times Video I highly recommend that you pass purchasing that item. Hopefully a REAL version of McLintock will be released by John Wayne's estate soon.  This movie was not one of John Wayne's favorites and was released late for being such a good movie.  Hopefully this had nothing to do with the estate of Mr. Wayne in releasing a crisp (and letter box) version.
 If you love McLintock! as much as I do, you WON'T buy this version from Good Times Video. The overall quality (picture, focus, screen ratios, etc.) is absolutely awful -- this goes for both their VHS and DVD versions.  If I could give it a half star I would. Apparently, the John Wayne Estate or his family lost control of either the reproduction or marketing rights to McLintock! some years ago, and Good Times took some Scotch brand tape, staples and chewing gum and patched together this awful copy. The good news is that John Wayne's family authorized a VHS version made from the original master footage, which is excellent.  Look for an orange box with the Wayne family authorization printed on the front.  Let's hope The Duke's family will work to produce an authorized DVD of McLintock as well.
 I can't believe Good Times Video actually released this DVD without doing any touch up whatsoever, nor even trying to get a better copy before making the DVD.  Normally one of the funner John Wayne movies, a sort of western version of  ;The Taming of the Shrew, ; it's nearly impossible to enjoy watching any of it due to the poor quality of the DVD.  From the opening credits to the closing credits, the image is full of scratches and holes.  There are even several complete scenes which are out of focus and blurry. This was obviously an attempt by Good Times to make a quick buck off of John Wayne's name.  Let's hope that at some point in the future someone gets the rights to this film, restores it, and cleans up the images so that the charm of this movie isn't lost to future generations.  Save your money on this one and pickup  ;The Quiet Man ; or  ;The Horse Soldiers ;. At least those DVD's are not hard on the eyes.
 DO NOT waste your money on the DVD of this great movie. Absolutely the worst quality I have ever seen in a DVD transfer. Wait for the wide screen version that, hopefully, will appear soon. The one star is for the quality of the DVD.  The movie itself is a solid 5.
 My main criticism of all the DVD versions of this movie is that there are lines that are missing. How this happens astounds me but I know the movie well and thankfully have kept an old VHS copy that is complete. The most notable exception is the scene where Maureen O'Hara bursts in on him playing chess and Birnbaum comments her hair looks a different shade. John Wayne laughs and says he is right, she did color her hair. Why cant they transfer a movie without cutting it up? All of John Wayne's movies need authorized editions that have been remastered badly!
 I remember this film from my youth as being a great movie, and people cheering in the theatre as the plot unfolded.  However, the intervening years have changed my opinion.  One of the greatest disservices it does is portray New York City as a uniform cesspool of unchecked crime.  It is illogical that Paul Kersey's family would live in a part of town where street thugs would so brazenly roam.  And, although it does make an attempt to show why Kersey, the man of peace, turns into the avenger, it takes place too swiftly.  Otherwise, this movie is talky, has LOUSY and irrelevant music, spends a great deal of time in digression, and is unrealistically resolved.  The DVD I viewed was a terrible transfer too, but this might not apply to the one being sold here.  I was more than disappointed.
 I am sorry for the review for all the HD Fans out there . I purchased a HD DVD player to go along side my Blu Ray player so I am not restricted to the issue of titles avail. So as I love this move and it is rated in my top 10 movies I went out and purchased this HD DVD version even though I have the remastered version (25th Ann) and boy was I so Disappointed. The picture quality alone on a normal DVD via the HD DVD Player or the  Bluray Player is far supior to this HD Version. SAVE YOUR MONEY
 I had always heard so much good about An American Werewolf in London.  I had set meself up for a really awesome movie.  What a profound disappointment.  While the special effects were first rate the rest of the movie was dreck.  The acting was totally cardboard and the storyline was like so totally canned and predictable.  The director \ story teller could have stopped the dialogue in mid film and just starting saying, AND YOU KNOW, LIKE AND YOU KNOW AND SO TOTALLY NARLY AND WE WOULD ALL KNOWN GOTTEN AND UNDERSTOOD THE LAME TEXT BOOK ENDING!  This movie really drags to be a mainstream production.  An American Werewolf in London is "The Right Stuff" of Werewolf movie fare boring and numbmingly predictable such that you watch the film thinking will it ever end.  Please let it end... PLEASE!  There is another Werewolf movie called Dark Wolf a total low budget B picture if I ever saw one.  The script is paper thin, the characters are badly acted, the special effects are just about good as those in American Werewolf in London but one thing makes Dark Wolf different.  Dark Wolf does not take itself seriously so while not particularly frightening it is funny.  There is enough blood and gore in the movie for any person.  The Movie is deservedly rated R because let's say your local Hooters has nothing on Dark Wolf.  The sadest thing is that in a battle of scripts Dark Wolf the solid B movie soundly trounces its mainsteam competition in every category.  Besides being the better more engaging if silly story Dark Wolf made up with laughs and visuals what it lacked in star power and location.  Amazon sells Dark Wolf if you want a real fun Werewolf buy it. An American Warewolf in London is more a study in Warewolves as Boring High Tone ART!  I don't know about you but keep the high tone artsy stuff when I want to see Werewolves I want it down and dirty with none of the sophisticated veiwing pleasure crap thrown in.
 ...a hundred more times instead of wasting another 90 minutes (or so, it felt like a year!) on this garbage. After watching this "legend" of a movie (I have no idea why it is so famous?) I felt confused. Is it supposed to be scary? Or funny? Or both?  "An american werewolf in London" was a disappointing movie-experience -not that "Wolf" (Nicholson, Pfieffer) was that great either, but it sure is much better than this so-called cult-classic!
 Werewolfs are like the Terminator. They cant be bargained with, they cant be reasoned with, they feel no pity or remorse and they will hunt you down until you are dead.  Well this alleged werewolf movie could have worked on the same premise. It opens with the protaganist and his friend arriving at a English Country Pub and not being warned by the townsfolk what lurks out there, just stay on the road they are told in short. Of course they dont and one friend ends up as a midnite snack. From thereon in it starts to degenerate into the poor kid who mutates into an animal that one can only describe as being part gray squirrel part wolf with a bobblehead that keeps, ehh, bobbing up and down and sideways as he walks and snaps.  Ladies and Gentleman, behold the WEIRDWOLF.  Not funny, not scary, not a werewolf movie by any means.
 I never received this DVD from the seller, despite emailing and requesting the courtesy of a response...I have not received either a response or the movie.  Guess I'm just out $27.00 with no American Werewolf in my collection. Would not recommend doing business here.
 I know a lot of people out there love American Werewolf in London but hate American Werewolf in Paris which i don't understand. American Werewolf in London is the worst werewolf movie i have seen if you want to see a proper good werewolf movie you should see the Howling not this. Also they say the movie is funny its not i only got a laugh out of it because of the thought the main female character had had sex with a werewolf besides that its boring. Seriously i love werewolf movies don't get me wrong but the werewolf in this film more looks like an over inflated hairy balloon with legs and a dog mask, it's nearly as bad as the bald, over sized annerixic hampster of a werewolf from Harry Potter 3. In short don't see this film other wise you'll want to watch something else remotely tasteful to wash out the bad taste
 I will never buy anything from this company AGAIN! They lied stating the dvd was "very good condition" that dvd was not even close to being what they stated, for starters the case where the dvd sits was broken so the dvd just rolls around loose and the dvd itself was scratched real bad!!! I wrote down the companies name so I know who NOT to buy from.
 This product is available with another name too i.e.  "Chemistry
 The movie opens with a man in the woods on Skull Mountain hunting "stock footage" deer. Suddenly a freak earthquake happens and a demon appears from the ground.  Skull Mountain got its name because Native Americans would boil the heads of their victims and place the skulls on sticks around the mountain. Not likely, but that is what the movie claims. Meanwhile Camille, who is psychic, is having visions of the demon killing various people on the mountain. She goes to investigate. Also on the mountain are two guys with a metal detector looking for treasure...finding a metal knife used by Native Americans. (When did they have an Iron Age?) This all ties together in an exciting climax you won't want to miss! No one will be allowed in the theater during the last 10 heart pounding minutes. Don't reveal the twisted bizarre ending to your friends! ;)  The hand is what we see most of the creature, who only attacks during the day because filming at night is more difficult. The dialouge was extremely bad, resorting to fart humor. 71 minutes long because they knew we wouldn't last 90. Tempe has made worse movies...Believe it or Not!  No sex. No nudity.
 I guess Amazon thought my original review was a little harsh, so I'll try again. PURE GARBAGE MADE BY AN INCOMPENTENT, NO TALENT CHILD WITH A CAMCORDER IN THE MID WEST AND IT ONLY COST $25.00.
 After watching most of this movie, these are the questions that were begging to be asked
 This workout has no warmup and no cooldown. It's the worst workout I've ever bought. I actually threw it in the trash.
 This is one of my most disappointing blu-ray purchases ever. As you can readily see from multiple sources, this film was shot 1.37
 Donald Hamilton created the ultimate hard-nosed spy in Matt Helm, a man who would always do what had to be done. Somehow this became used as a farce by Dean Martin. One can only wonder why the filmmakers would want to waste money buying rights to Matt Helm when they didn't intend to use anything from the books, or create a character even vaguely comparable. Even the James Bond series in its early incarnations had some relationships to Fleming, although it too ultimately degenerated into farce until Daniel rescued it. But this Dean Martin nonsense--stupid, poorly paced, poorly written and most of all---utterly irrelevant to the great books that are now, alas, out of print.
 If my memory serves me right, I seem to remember seeing bits and pieces of these films on television as I was growing up.  By the time, though, that I finally saw enough of one to really understand, I had made the wonderful discovery of Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm novels.  After reading only two of Hamilton's tough, spare writing style about the cynical counterintelligence agent pulled back reluctantly back into service when things get too close to his family, I could never again watch these movies without wincing in pain every moment.  I guess Irwin Allen thought he couldn't create an American counterpart to Fleming's James Bond, so he decided to spoof him. Even as a parody it's painful.  (Humorist P.J. O'Rourke, explains parody this way
 This is a review of the DVDs and not the movies.  I like all four movies and I am a big Dino fan.  However, I am greatly disappointed in the current presentation of these movies.  None of the formats are in widescreen and they have all been edited for television.  This is ridiculous and unacceptable.  With the world moving to high definition, these formatted to fit your tv DVDs will soon be outdated.  You know that once this occurs the DVD company will re-issue this box set in widescreen format and charge us more money !!!  Booo !!!  As for the editing, I am calling it censorship.  If you want to edit your product for whatever reason, then let us (the buyer) know somewhere on the package.  I bought these movies under the false pretense that I was getting the full version of each picture.  I don't care what is edited out or the reason why, but the DVD producer should inform us that these are edited versions and let us determine whether we want to buy them.  Don't waste your money on something that will be replaced in a few years and for which you will eventually have to shell out more money !!!!!
 For those of you who are Dean Martin;/Matt Helm fans, this is the set to pass on.  The movies have been edited for TV and a lot of content has been removed due to subject matter.  There are unedited editions out there and I highly suggest searching for those.  The set is very dissappointing for collectors, it isn't even worth a one star rating.
 I could not make it past the first half hour of it because it was so graphic and seemed to just be going in an endless circle/cycle! I hated every second of it and should have turned it off way sooner, but I just love Heath Ledger so I tried to get through it. It was awful!!
 ANSWER 
 I wanted to get the DVD of "growing pains"-a TV show. And when i searched, it showed in AMAZON. So i ordered. But the true name of DVD i got from AMAZON is "a guide for parents to growing pains", not the one i wanted. Why the item did not show its true name in AMAZON? It is cheating!
 can someone tell us what this is. Is this the first season of growing pains? Or is it something else?
 Don't be fooled by shady sellers like Musicisus2001 who won't give refunds. This is really "A Parent's Guide to Growing Pains." Amazon should post a picture of the case to clarify all the confusion.
 Historical epics have been a part of Chinese cinema for a long time, and now that Jackie Chan has grown just a tad too old to pull the insane stunts of his youth, it makes sense that his latest film, his first directorial effort since 1998's Who Am I?, is 1911, a historical drama about the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew China's last imperial dynasty. Released on the 100th anniversary of the revolution and marking Chan's 100th film, 1911 was unfortunately a failure here in the States, where it took home just over $135,000 at the box office is one of the worst films of Chan's career. The problem, is that the film relies too heavily on title cards to explain already convoluted plot points, rendering the proceedings more akin to a history lesson than a piece of entertainment. If you aren't already familiar with the story taking place, you may find 1911 tedious, overlong, and dry, three words you'd never have thought to associate with a Jackie Chan movie.
 In my opinion, this is one of Jackie Chan's weakest movies. The pace of the movie left no room for actor play and character development. Unless someone understands the history of what was happening in China in 1911 (which I do not), it is hard to make sense of what is going on in the movie. There is an attempt to put the explanation and commentary on the screen, but the font is so small, it is impossible to read in regular definition resolution. After watching the movie I have no more knowledge or understanding of what happened in China in 1911. I also could not bring myself to connect with any of the characters.  The biggest thing that just escapes me with this movie, though, is this. Does Jackie Chan really believe that the revolution was a good thing for China and that Communism has anything good to offer? Was the movie a piece of propaganda forced onto him by the Chinese government (which would explain why the movie is so bad)? I just do not get it.
 Disjointed movie. Bad Chinese propaganda linking the 1911 revolution for democracy to the 1949 communist revolution that installed a dictator government. Jackie Chan sold out.
 Watching the trailers for this movie I didn't think it would be very good, but I was quite prepared to have my mind changed, particularly since it had such a good cast.  The story is obviously taken from The Dead Poet's Society, but this time given a feminist edge.  That feminist edge is Julia Roberts, a thoroughly modern miss who takes a class of art students at a conservative college, only to realise that it's really just a finishing school.  There's an appropriate array of stereotypes
 I don't remember why I rented this movie.  Maybe it was watching the trailers, and just hoping, that it would not be as bad as it appeared from the those.  Nope, it was.  And then some.  Everyone said that this was like Dead Poet's Society, but with women, but it just wasn't.  Dead Poet's society had an engaging teacher and interesting, quirky students.  This was some kind of Hollywood consciousness raising that fails miserably.  Julia Roberts playing that art teacher was really not all that convincing to begin with.  Actors have to transmit some kind of inherent intelligence to be believable as teachers.  She does not.  And, as usual in movies, the orders of the art time periods are mixed.  Its cave painting, then Pollack, then Van Gogh.  Uh, ok?  As for the actresses, the only one I found somewhat palatable was Ginnifer Goodwin, who to me played someone who was not a stereotype or a caricature.  The rest of them....  Julia Stiles plays an overachiever.  Again.  Maggie Gyllenhall as the one who sleeps around and Kristen Dunst as the marrying one.  Boring.  Kristen Dunst's marriage falls apart.... What a shock.  I also couldn't understand why this movie was made.  The 50's were a really divisive time in America, and set the stage for the 1960's.  So this slice of life from the privileged classes enjoying the privileges of the privileged classes is supposed to remind us of the "good old days" when women wore chastity belts, I mean girtles?  Women worked back then, women go to college looking for a husband now.  What message is this movie trying to transmit?  I have no idea.  Now these are just the same comments everyone makes, but the movie lacked one more thing.  Flesh.  Sex.  I'm not saying they should be making porn here, and I know, PG-13, and all, but no intimate situations are ever shown.  Just one scene of one of these girls, just alone, talking to their significant other, privately, the way couples do, would have been sufficient.  Instead, its just "oh, let's get married.  Let's get divorced," etc.  Like that's what the script says.  I got the feeling that maybe there were some scenes like that, but that committee that makes the movies in Hollywood, so that they are as bland as possible and reach as wide an audience as possible said "cut the sex.  Don't want America's children to know anything about life."  If you must see a Julia Roberts movie, rent My Best Friend's Wedding.  That one at least has some singing in it.
 The theme of this movie is that women should be able to have it all
 WHEN I FIRST HEARD ONE REVEIW ON THE MOVIE THEY MENTIONED THE MOVIE  ;DEAD POETS SOCIETY ; THAT MOVIE WAS WONDERFUL. THEN I SAW THIS ONE WELL SUCKED. I SPENT AOLMOST THREE HOURS SEEING SOMETHING COPYING A MOVIE I LIKED AND NOT VERY WELL. I LOVE A LOT OF JULIA ROBERTS STUFF. BUT SHE WAS TERRIBLE IN IT AND IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME. I DIDN'T LIKE ANY OF THE CHARACTERS AT ALL. AND IT NEVER REACHED A GOOD POINT. EVEN AT THE END WHEN KIRSTEN DUNST FINALLY COMES AROUND I WANTED TO HIT HER. THE OTHER THING IS IN  ;DEAD POETS ; THE DAD WAS MEAN AND CRUEAL AND YOU COULDN'T PUSH HIM AROUND. IN THIS I FELT I COULD TAKE THE MOM. SHE WAS ANNOYING AND EVEN IN THE 50S YOU COULS SEE THAT. ALSO THE SPECIAL FEATURES AREN'T THAT GOOD AT ALL. IF YOU INTO THEM THEY HAE A SPACE THAT HAS TRAILERS. THEN YOU GO OUT TO THE MAIN MENU AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER SPACE THAT SAYS TRAILERS AND THEY WERE THE SAME ONES AS IN THE OTHER SPACE. THE  CAST DIDN'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT THE MOVIE BUT THEY ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE TIME PERIOD. I HATED IT AND THINK PEOPLE EVERY WHERE SHOULD BURN IT!
 This movie is really BAD. The acting is horrible and the overall plot is crap. See one of the actresses other movies. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!!!
 This is yet another example of Hollywood's liberal attacks on America's most popular decade. There are books written about teenagers that portray all of them as rebels that were out to destroy their parents. As a teenager (actually I was in my early 20s; I was born in 1935) in the 1950s, I came across NO ONE who had these feelings at all both in high school and college. Neither did my teenaged sisters. ANYWAY, let's look at this  film
 You're not like the lady with the mystic smile Is it only that you're a commie we have blamed you For your anti-traditional viewpoints in your smile Do you smirk at moral values, Kathy Watson? Or is this your way of breaking lonely hearts? Many lies have been brought to our doorsteps They just lie there, and they die there Are they real, are they fake, Kathy Watson? Or just a cold and lonely, hateful piece of art?
 If you are trying to gain a few brownie points by renting a nice chick flick for your significant other, whatever you do, do not torture yourself with this mess. I can't possibly find one redeeming thing to say about  ;Mona Lisa Smile ;. It's not romantic. No nudity or even partial anything. Total lack of pretty sets or scenery. Clothes are way conservative and non-revealing. Officially zero car chases and/or explosions. Do whatever it takes to get out of sitting through this
 I liked Jennifer Weiner's book and even followed her columns about standing on the set watching this movie get made.  My daughter and I then went to see this movie and we were both disappointed.  The first problem is the casting - it is just impossible to see Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette as sisters.  Collette never had a smile on her face and it was impossible to believe that she was an intelligent lawyer. Diaz's acting ranges from a to b (as Dorothy Parker once said about Katherine Hepburn). Shirley MacLaine was also woefully miscast as the grandmother; she barely phoned in her performance and never took on the role.  This viewer was always conscious of watching Shirley MacLaine.  There was also a problem with Curtis Hanson as the director; the movie just did not have the light touch of a romantic comedy and it dragged.  On the other hand, Mark Feuerstein was one bright spot, even if there was no chemistry on screen between him and Toni Collette. I'd suggest saving your money.
 I thought In Her Shoes would be better after watching the trailer and previews for the film.  I found it to be vulgar, boring, and I fell asleep trying to watch it so often, I just took it back to Blockbuster.  Don't waste your time...move is a snore!
 If you have a sister, maybe watch this with her, it's about sisters, I guess ... If she's as horrible an actress as Diaz, CLUB HER TO DEATH WITH A SHOE. If you have this sort of relationship with your sibling, please seek help!  I'm serious.  Other than that burn it like an evil witch trying to eat your kidney!  I like a poignant 'chick flick', but this is not a chick flick, this is a collection of the tritest white American stereotypes thrown together.  Sleazy rich partners in law firms; whorish and dumb sister who steals money (oh, but she's not dumb because she's lazy and never read or studied, oh no, she has dyslexia); money hungry Jewish step mom; dad who is warm but totally disconnected (why is the dad never blamed in these movies?); unsatisfied career girl who just wants a good man to order her food; spunky WASP grandmother; heartwarming old man who dies (are old people tired of being inspiration for obnoxious, young jerks?); my favorite was the bland boyfriend who is part of the worst show of race tokenism I've ever seen ('Oh look, Johnny Blandman can talk to those black people about their fancy 'basketball', he's so nice')  Any movie where Diaz criticizes someone for being too skinny should be immediately banned throughout the world.  As for Diaz being 'hot'... ick!  Hard to have cellulite when your skin is taut on your bones.  ...and those teeth!  Like looking at a Mexican Day of the Dead doll.  If you must have a 'chick flick' try the older Fried Green Tomatoes or Chocolat or Eat/drink, Man/Woman, or even A Walk to Remember.... anything.  There is no meaning or warmth in this movie!
 I saw this movie on the plane to Europe and to tell you the truth I didn't like it at all. It's a bad story itself, but the actors were horrible. How could Cameron Diaz sleep with her sister's boyfriend? I think it's one of those movies that if you don't see you don't lose anything. It's bad, real bad.
 OK, my GF negoiated me into seeing this film.  If you can buy a dinner instead, DO SO!!!  This movie is a strict chick flick - no comedy, no action, boring, slow, all about feelings and relationships between parent and siblings (and in laws).  Plus it is depressing...
 Like it's previous Stargate, the sound is poorly done.  Which if Amazon had encoded CC wouldn't be a significant issue.  I don't understand why sound people think everything has to scream at you.  Silence is Golden.  Dialogue is what is important, music and sound effects should be in the background where they belong.  It's like having to watch commercials where you always have to mute the screaming idiots!!!!!  Hopefully one day, someone will recognize that when it comes to sound, less is better....
 I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever. The plot is just plain awful. The sets and costumes were beautifully done, the acting wasn't bad, but that's not enough to save this #@%$(* of a film.
 Worst video ever!!!!!  Don't waste your money.  Poor poor video quality,  people walk in front of the camera shots.  The video has bird, frog and other various sounds that have nothing to do with the bird or animal on the poor quality video.  You won't like it, your cat won't like it, and that is an understatement.
 what an absurd title for this set. black oil. as opposed to what? white oil? pink oil? i certainly hope that they dont expect to sell this set to anyone other than established fans. because i would scoff & giggle at the redundant title. its a glaring reminder of the 'cheese factor' that seemed to bubble up to the surface sometimes during the shows run. whats next
 Maybe it's for people in the dance world. Didn't understand it for some reason. Just didn't get it. Don't know.....
 I haven't read the book, so I had no idea what to expect. I heard people singing its praises, so I thought I'd watch it. It looked a little corny, so I was already braced for that. It's not really corny, it's just really boring. I don't have anything against British cinema or period set movies, but this one just went on and on and left me wondering where it was going.  The storyline is rushed, which wouldn't be that bad if they didn't also rush the character development. The movie just presents the girls as growing up into pretty teenagers that get sent to a performance academy due to financial need, this being paid by one of the elder sister's, Sylvia (Emilia Fox), tenants.  From there, you just get a feeling of entitlement from the girls. It's like watching a 30's set version of My Super Sweet Sixteen. Pauline (Emma Watson) soon gets a big head because she's pretty and it assures her roles in acting. Watson's acting is terrible. I love her in Harry Potter, probably because I'm so used to seeing her as Hermione, but even in that role I think she's a pretty mediocre actress. Ballet Shoes gave her a chance to shine on her own light, but she looks too old for the role and makes her character come off like a drama queen.  Posy (Yasmin Paige)is supposed to be gifted in ballet, hence the title, but other than that, we don't really see her dance well. Furthermore, it's not really clear why it should be titled Ballet Shoes because her dancing is a pretty minor thing in the plotline. It only makes her come off as a spoiled brat and only diverts the attention from golden-girl Watson for a mere seconds.  Speaking of temporary attention detractor, this brings me to Petrova (Lucy Boynton), who the movie treats just like the author did when picking her name. She moans a little bit about hating performance and wanting to be a pilot. The audience is supposed to feel sorry for this character but instead it just feels like a breath of fresh air to have a character not being painted as beautiful and talented in this movie. I didn't particularly like her more than the other orphans, but it was less boring to watch her struggle where she didn't belong than having to watch Watson's character whine because she was in an early film.  Overall, the movie version of Ballet Shoes butchers any meaning in the story by using cheap techniques like the apparently made-up romance between adult characters and constantly trying to make the audience feel sorry for the orphans. The former fails simply because they were adopted when they were babies by loving people, had the good fortune to find some random lady to pay for an education, where blessed with good looks and are considered talented enough to earn a living. They also kept reminding us they were poor, which I felt hard to sympathize with seeing as they still had new-looking clothes to wear and lived in a house bigger than mine.  Based on the reviews I've read, this movie is no good unless you have the lingering memory of the book. I have not read the book, so I only have the lingering memory of frequently checking how much time was left of the movie.
 I've tried it in my DVD player, my laptop (bought about a year ago), my Xbox 360 slim, and another DVD player.  Returning this.  I really wanted to watch Emma Watson.  
 My daughter and I bought this DVD because we both loved the book by Noel Streatfeild.  But the movie is missing all the aspects that made the book so interesting.  The movie leaves out almost everything about the Academy of Dancing and Stage Training and the girls' daily lives.  It adds unnecessary romances between adult characters.  There is a lot of cigarette smoking and drinking in the movie, making it unsuitable for children.  There is almost no dancing shown.  The actors who play the three girls are *way* too old for the parts. Finally, (and this is a matter of taste but for me it was very distracting) the hairstyles are terrible.
 this was a real downer.  The young girls were alway worried about money and doing danceing to help pay for bills.  While paying the bills was a good reason to begain with, the girl become selfish.  They built little friendship or respect of each other.  I could have watched the true life story of any troubled child actor's if I wanted to watch children act for just the money. The girls in the movie danced and acted because they hand to and in the end they really never learned anything but to keep working even if it was hurting the family.  In the end the family is pulled apart and but since everyone gets what they want it's ok.  Right?!  Keeping the family together and letting the girl have childhoods is not as important as getting the money.  By the way, the girls only have to go to dance school, never mind making their own dress or cleaning their rooms or cooking.  Their parent will do all that. What a joke.  I would never show this to my nieces because I would hate it if they ended up a spoiled and selfish as these girls.
 Nothing against Amazon.com, but I did not like this movie as there is one scene where all three of the girls are in the circle and making a promise about getting their names in the history books, and one girl ends the promise with "Amen".  The other two girls look at her suprised that she said "Amen" because they have never said "Amen" before and she responds that they need help and she does not care where it comes from.  This was VERY disappointing to me.  It seems that people only call on God when they need help and then walk away once they have received what they needed.  So, I was no longer interested in watching the movie.
